<h2 class='nobreak'>HOW I CAME TO HAVE IT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I was</span> one time traveling in France. I was a young
man without object—without occupation. Literature
was the last thing in my thoughts—indeed I believe
it never would have entered into them, but for a word
or two of encouragement from an American gentleman,
most dear to me after a lapse of five-and-twenty
years, most high in my esteem as a man, and in my
admiration as an author. He gave the first impulse
to my mind in a certain direction. His opinion was
confirmed by another, equally dear, and equally admired
by us both, and I became in consequence of an
accidental meeting in a remote city of France, what
I am, and what I am proud to be—a literary man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some time after this accidental meeting that
I was traveling in another Department, as they call
it now-a-days, or Province as they called it long ago,
when I stopped at an inn or hotel, God bless the
mark!—in the famous city of Rennes, the capital of
Brittany. The town is a fine old quiet town, which
looks as if a good deal of sleep had been the portion
of the inhabitants since the revolution; but nevertheless,
it has a great number of pleasant people in it, a
great number of agreeable social parties, much elegance
and grace in its higher circles, and a numerous
collection of beautiful faces and forms—for all of
which I am devoutly thankful, as in duty bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One’s first advent to such a town, however, can
never be particularly gay. The circumstances which
brought me there, and detained me there for a long
time, could not be matters of interest for the general
public, but I will own that the first day-light view
of the city, though striking and in some degree beautiful—and
there are few towns for which I have such
a lingering love; perhaps on the same motives which
made De Coucy love Fontenoy—was in some degree
dull and monotonous; and before I delivered the few
letters of introduction which I brought with me, I
took a stroll through the streets, with no very pleasant
feeling or anticipation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had previously passed through that deeply interesting
part of France, the Bocage, where deeds of
heroism enough were enacted to have made ancient
Rome really great—where heroes fought and died,
with a constancy and a quiet fortitude which would
have shamed warriors of old, and have put the stoic to
the blush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a bright and beautiful land, notwithstanding
the desolation which the fierce wrath of the multi-form
tyranny of republicanism inflicted upon it—notwithstanding
the decimation of its inhabitants, and
the spilling of the noblest blood that France had ever
produced. The dim embowering lanes, deep cut between
the fields; the arching boughs over head, the
vineyards, and the orchards, the quiet little villages,
nooked in bosky shade; the frequent farm-houses,
and the châteaux great and small, which thickly dot
the whole of that peculiar region, had produced an
effect—strange to say—gay—cheerful—and pleasant,
rather than sad, notwithstanding all the gloomy memories
of glorious deeds unfruitful, and heroic courage
rewarded by death, with which the whole air is
loaded. France may boast of her conquests—of the
successes which were obtained by the fierce irruption
of the barbarous hordes into dismayed and unconnected
lands—of the talent of her generals—of the courage
of her plundering troops—of triumph, bitterly atoned
by forgotten humiliation; but her real glory lies in
La Vendee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had gone through this beautiful country—this country
dear to the heart of every one who loves honor
more than success, and I had come to the extreme
point of the frontier, where a great city had possessed
the means, and never used them, of rendering gallant
devotion triumphant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feeling with which I viewed it was, perhaps,
not that of disappointment; but a sort of
gloom pervaded my mind, a sensation of solitariness—of
isolation, not common in French cities,
where every one usually seems ready to take upon
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
himself the character of acquaintance, if not of
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On entering my inn, which was one where dinner
was served <span class='it'>à la carte</span>. I chose from the bill of fare,
such viands as I thought proper, and sat down to read
the newspaper in the public room till the meal was
served.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While thus occupied, two or three people came in
and went out again; but one person remained, spoke
a few words to the waiter, seated himself in a chair
on one side of the long wooden board which served
as a very unornamental dinner-table, and taking up
one of the public papers, began to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time I gave a glance at him, and I thought
I recognized the features. A second look showed
me that I had seen him more than once before in various
towns of France. I had even a faint recollection
of having met him in good society in England.
So it proved; for a short time after, the stranger’s
eye turned upon me, and he immediately remembered
me. Our acquaintance, previously, had been confined
to a few words, and an occasional bow when
we met; but here we were seated together in a dull
inn, in a dull town in Brittany—cast as it were upon
each other for society; and it may be easily supposed
that we soon became more intimate, although I did
not altogether like or understand my acquaintance.
He was certainly a good-looking man, but his appearance
was somewhat singular. He was tall, very
powerful in frame, though rather meagre than otherwise,
full-chested, broad-shouldered, thin in the flank,
long and sinewy in limb. His nose was strongly aquiline,
his eye over-arched by a very prominent eye-brow,
was dark, bright and quick. He wore neither
whisker nor mustache, and I remarked that his teeth
were beautifully white and perfect, although at this
time he must have been considerably above fifty.
His dress never varied at any time I saw him, consisting
of a black coat, waistcoat and handkerchief,
drab breeches, and English top-boots. His hat always
shone like a looking-glass, and his gloves always fitted
beautifully, and seemed to be fresh that day. I found
that he spoke English and French with equal facility,
and I never could get any one to tell me what was
his country. Frenchmen, who heard him speak, declared
at once that he was French, and that no foreigner
could ever acquire the accent so perfectly.
Englishmen, and myself amongst the number felt sure
that he was English, judging by the same test; and
I am rather inclined to believe now, that he was in
reality a Russian spy. He never, by any chance,
alluded to his country, to his profession, or to his
habits—except indeed, one day, when he called himself
a wandering spirit, rarely remaining more than
three days in the same place. He must have been
well acquainted with Rennes, however; for he knew
every nook and corner in the city, and had evidently
some knowledge of a great many people in it, for he
bowed to many, spoke to several; but although I afterward
asked several persons whom I had seen him
thus recognize, who he was, none of them could tell
me, and most of them seemed not much to like the
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first night, we dined together, and shared a
bottle of very good wine, which he, either by prescience
or memory, recommended as the best which
the house could afford. We talked of the town, and
of that part of France, and of La Vendee, and in the
end, finding I was curious about relics of the ancient
times, he offered to take me to some curious
places in the vicinity of the town. On the following
morning we set out in a carriage from the inn—and
here let me notice his scrupulous exactness in paying
his precise share of every expense incurred. He
never sought to pay more, but would never consent
to pay less. On our return, our conversation naturally
fell upon all we had seen. We talked of the
Chouans, and the Vendean war, and all the gallant
deeds that were done in those days, and from that we
turned to the Revolutionary history in general, and
especially to the campaigns of Massena, and the Arch-Duke
Charles, and Suwarow in Lombardy and
Switzerland. He gave me a number of curious anecdotes
of those personages, and especially of Suwarow,
whom he told me he had himself seen leading
on a charge, with a jockey-cap upon his head, a
switch in his hand, a boot upon one leg, and a silk
stocking on the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those were strange times,” he said, “and many
of the greatest, and most striking events in history
which occurred about that time, are already hardly
remembered, from the fact that so many marvelous
actions were crowded into so short a space of time,
as hardly to leave room to see or to collect them. I
was about thirty at the time of that terrible struggle
in Switzerland,” he added, “and my memory is quite
perfect upon the subject; but when I talk with other
people upon those things, and especially with historians,
they know little or nothing about them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have gone through some strange adventures,
I should think,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear no,” he replied, “my life has been an
exceedingly quiet and tranquil one; but if you are
curious about that period of history, I have got a
manuscript which fell into my hands accidentally,
giving some interesting particulars of a young man’s
life in those days. There is a good deal of nonsensical
sentimentality in it, but it may amuse you, and
if you like to take the trouble to read it, I will lend
it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I accepted his offer right willingly, but the conversation
turned soon to other things, and he and I both
forgot the manuscript that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day, at breakfast, he announced
to me that he was going to start by the Diligence at
noon, for Nantes, Bordeaux, and Madrid. I laughingly
asked what would become of my reading the
manuscript then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you shall have it! You shall have it,” he
answered. “We shall meet again I dare say, and
then you can give it back to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he went, he brought it down—a large roll
of somewhat yellow paper. Conceiving it might be
valuable, and without the slightest idea of prying into
his affairs, I asked where I could send it to him,
if we did not meet soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
He replied, with a very peculiar smile, “it does not
matter. It does not matter. If I do not see you before
thirteen years are over, I shall then be seventy
years of age or dead, and you may do with it what
you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than twenty years have now passed, and we
have not met, and I give the manuscript to the world
with very little alteration, trusting that if the writer
of the autobiography which follows should ever see
these pages, he will claim his own and forgive their
publication. I will only add, that when I received
the manuscript, I certainly thought that my good
friend of the inn was the writer of it himself. In
reading it over, however, and especially in correcting
it for the press, I perceived that could not be, as
the age of the parties must have differed by fifteen or
sixteen years.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE FIRST FISH.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Most men have a faint and distant notion from
whom to look for parentage—that inestimable boon
for which the most miserable often feel the most
grateful—inestimable, not only because it confers
upon us, if we will, an immortal hereafter of unrevealed
joy and glory, but because nobody ever has,
ever will, or probably ever can, estimate it rightly.
Parents consider their children as under an undischargeable
debt of gratitude to them for bringing
them into the world at all, without sometimes fully
considering a parent’s duties as well as his rights.
Children are too apt to make light of the obligation,
as well as many another obligation which succeeded
it—the care of infancy, the guidance of youth, the
love, unextinguishable in all but very cold and stony
hearts, which attends our offspring from their birth
to our own death-bed. It may be argued that all
these acts and feelings on the part of parents, are but
in obedience to a law of nature: that the man or
woman is like the eagle or the dove, is impelled to
nurture, protect, defend his offspring. But if so, the
law of love and obedience of the offspring to the parent,
is equally binding; and he who neglects the one,
is equally a rebel to nature, and to God, as he who
neglects the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most men, I repeat, have a faint and distant notion
from whom to look for parentage. This is not without
exception. Good, as a general rule, the exceptions
are quite sufficient to prove it. I myself am
one. That I had a father, I take for granted: that I
had a mother is perfectly certain. But as to who
my father and my mother were, was for many years
a question much more doubtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, I will tell you all about it, and you shall
judge for yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first recollections of the world are surrounded
by somewhat strange scenery. Figure to yourself,
reader, a town situated on the top of a high hill, like
an eagle’s eyrie, but far more solid and substantial.
The streets are paved with large round stones, and a
gutter in the centre, tracking out like rays at every
cross-road: the houses, stone-built, and somewhat
ponderous, are tall and short, wide and narrow, as in
most other towns, but there are some very fine
churches in a somewhat severe style in the place,
and it seems to possess two peculiar characteristics.
Whether, because so far elevated that nothing could
obstruct the drainage on every side, or because at
that high point it caught the clouds as they whirled
by, and attracted the wrath of every storm by its menacing
front, it was the cleanest town in the universe.
In vain did cooks and old women throw out cock’s-heads
divested of their combs, and the gizzards of
ducks and fowls—in vain on the Saturday night was
every gutter in the place made the receptacle of all
the dust of all the houses—in vain were a number of
other untidy tricks practiced to defile the highways,
and offend the olfactories of the passing stranger—before
the Monday morning all was clear again—except
in very rainy seasons, when I have known a
dust-heap lie for a fortnight. This was one of its peculiar
characteristics: cleanliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot help thinking there is something very
merry in dirt. The very merriest people I have
ever seen in my life have been the dirtiest; but perhaps,
after all, the impression to this effect which I
have received, may be attributed to my residence in
that old town, where the exceeding cleanliness I have
mentioned, was closely associated with that of dullness.
The very cheerful summer sun, as he looked
down into the open streets, held up as upon a pedestal
to his view, looked dull and even sad. The clear
light of the summer day had a cool, calm, gentlemanly
melancholy about it, which did not serve to
rouse or to enliven. One looked up the street and
saw a man, a single solitary man, so lost in the yellow
sunshine at the end, that you could not tell
whether he had pike, pitch-fork, or crosier in his
hand—three-cornered hat, or round, or cap of liberty
on his head. One looked down the street toward the
valley below, and could hardly make out whether the
lonely carriage drawn by four beasts of some kind,
had really four horses, or four mules, or four rats
without a tail—amongst them. Not another being
did you see. No heads were put out of windows—no
idle figures presented themselves before the doorways.
Curiosity seemed dead in the place, as well as
every thing else; and although the sound of a carriage
wheels—especially coming from below, where
there was a post-house—was very rare, it seemed
not to awaken any interest in the inhabitants whatsoever,
at least not more than was displayed in just
raising the eyes from the calves’ feet, or the sheep’s
trotters which were preparing for dinner, to look for
one instant at the vehicle, as it passed. If an earthquake
had rumbled up and down the street, it could
not have produced less excitment—and probably
would not have produced more. The carriage went
in peace and sunshine upon its way, and the cook or
the good house-wife bent her attention to her dishes
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But let me say a little more of the town before I
proceed farther; for it is an object of great interest to
me, even in memory. From the hill on which it
stood, and the old walls which surrounded it on every
side, rising up from the verge of the descent, and
looking like the battlements of a raised pie, might be
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
seen a very rich and beautiful country, with a river
running round the base of the large rock on which
one stood. The situation was a very commanding
one; for though rising ground, deserving the name
of high hills, was to be seen in the distance, and
many a sweep and undulation lay between, yet the
elevation of the town was sufficient to domineer over
the whole country around within any thing like
cannon-shot. The walls, however, were destitute
of guns; and the various gates, with their old stone
arches, seemed formed for no other purpose than to
let the morning and evening sun shine through, and
the country-people to bring in eatables and drinkables
for the supply of the place. They afforded,
too, a place of refuge for certain old gentlemen who
engaged themselves in examining all itinerant merchants,
making good women open their baskets, and
running long iron things, like spits, into loads of hay
and straw, in order to make sure that there was no
wine or brandy concealed within. For all these
services they exacted a trifling toll, or excise duty,
upon a great number of articles of provision brought
into the town. They were very unobtrusive people,
however, seldom, if ever seen, except in the early
part of market-days, and ever ready to retreat into
their little dens by the side of the gate, as soon as
their functions were performed. The great church
stood at one side of a little square, free and open
enough—always very clean, like the rest of the town,
but always looking exceedingly cool also—for the
very summer sun looked cool there, as I have observed,
and one hardly felt the difference between
June and December, if the day was clear. I don’t
know why all that square never looked gay or
cheerful—for it seemed to have every thing to make
it so; and I have seen it, on days of festivity, tricked
out in all that could assist. On the Sunday, a great
multitude of the good people of the town, dressed out
in their brightest attire, were continually flocking in
and out of the church. On festival days you would
see garlands of flowers, and banners, and rich vestments,
and beautifully dressed altars under arbors of
green leaves, and a little body of soldiers, with gay
uniforms, glittering muskets, and cocked-hats, would
appear to keep the ground as a procession passed.
But still it never looked cheerful. All these objects
were seen in that clear, cool light in such a
way as to make them look frosty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps one cause of the general sombreness of
the town, and the impression of uninhabitedness
which it gave, might have been that there were no
shops in the place. This may seem an extraordinary
fact—but so it was. There were no real, proper,
<span class='it'>bona fide</span> shops, with good, wide, open fronts showing
their wares. As one walked along the principal
street, indeed, which led through a large, heavy,
white stone arch, down the easiest slope of the hill
into the open country, here and there, in the window
of what seemed a private dwelling-place, and which
could only be reached by ascending a flight of steps
from the street, one might see a ham hanging up, or
a string of sausages, or some other edible thing.
Again, farther on, you would see a small brass basin
nailed to a door-post, and again, in another window,
a lady’s cap, or a string or two of ribbons. When
in want of any article, you climbed the steps, you had
to open a door, and then another door, before you
arrived at the person whom you expected to furnish
them. When you got in you would find a tolerable
store of different kinds of articles, gathered together
in a neat little room, somewhat dull and shady, and
not the least like a shop in the world. It would
have puzzled any one in such a cell to judge accurately
of the color or quality of what he was purchasing;
but I must do the good people the justice
to say that they did not at all take advantage of this
obscurity to cheat their friends and customers, but
that all they sold was generally good and what it
pretended to be—more, indeed, than can be said of
most goods and chattels at the present time. The
irregularity of the streets, too, might have had some
part in creating the sombreness—for they turned and
wound in an inconceivable manner, and the houses,
built according to the taste and will of the owner,
without any regard to regularity—some sticking out
six or seven yards beyond its neighbor—some turning
at one angle and some at another—some towering
up, and others crouching down—had an exceedingly
awkward habit of casting long, blue shadows,
whichever way the sun shone, in hard, straight lines,
unbroken by even a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have never seen any other town like it but one,
and that is the town of Angouleme. Perhaps it was
Angouleme—though I cannot be quite sure; for it is
long, long ago since I was there, and events and circumstances
of a very mingled character have drawn
line after line across the tablet of memory, till even
the deep strokes graven upon it in early years are
only faintly traceable here and there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In looking back as far as my mind will carry roe
into the past, there comes first a cloud—a pleasant,
summer-like cloud, not altogether shapeless, yet
very faint and soft in the outlines, and varying
strangely as I look at it. Now it takes the form of
a beautiful lady, with two or three lovely children
playing around her. I am among them; but whether
I am one of them or not I cannot tell. Then it
changes to a tall, somewhat youthful-looking man,
with a sword at his side, and a great broad belt over
his right shoulder. Heavy buckskin gloves he must
have worn; for I remember quite well the hard
touch of them between my little fingers. I see his
jack-boots, too, even now. They are the very
plainest part of the cloud. But the masses roll over—and
what is seen next? A French château, with
as many little towers as a cruet-stand, some square,
some round, some with conical roofs, some with
long gables, and at the end there is a small building,
which, in the nonsensical slang of London house-agents,
would be called semi-detached. It has a
little spire, like that of a church, and a bell in it.
Probably it was the chapel of the château; and there
is a fountain playing before the house in the morning
sun, surrounded by gay beds of flowers, formed into
strange shapes, as if cut out by those ingenious instruments
with which cooks produce variety in the
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
patterns of fancy pie-crust. But it is all a cloud,
never fixed, and never very clearly defined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first distinct and definite recollection that I
have, is that of finding myself in the town I have
mentioned, and in the house of one of the clergy of
the place—an excellent good man, if one ever lived.
But that is a general recollection, and the most
clear as well as the earliest of my more particular
recollections is that of having sat by the side of a
large pond, or little lake, formed by the stream
which flowed round the hill, and with a good stout
rod of very plain construction, and a tremendously
thick line and large hook, throwing in some kind
of bait, I forget what, in the desperate hope of
catching a gigantic pike, which was reported to frequent
that water. My line lay in the tank for a long
while without the slightest movement of the little
cork float attached to it. I got somewhat weary,
and began to think fishing poor sport. I laid my rod
down upon the bank, gathered a heap of stones, and
began throwing them as far as I could toward the
centre of the piece of water. This was not pure
idleness; for I had some indefinite notion, I believe,
of driving the fish nearer to the shore. The day had
hitherto been fine. A bright, soft, sleepy light, had
lain upon the bosom of the water. But it was now
about four o’clock, and the day began to change.
First there came a shadow, then a breeze tossing up
little waves, then thick, dashing drops of rain. I ran
some twenty steps back under a little ledge of the
rock, which afforded some shelter; for it would
seem I had been possessed with a notion in my
early youth, that I ought not to get wet; and there,
from my little den, I looked out at the storm as it
swept over the lake. It struck me then as very
beautiful, and I dare say would have struck me
more now; for through the thick drops, I could see
here and there the blue sky shining like a loving eye
watching the earth, and to the westward came a
gleam of gold, telling that the storm would not
last long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What induced me to look down for my rod and
line, I do not know; but when at the end of a quarter
of an hour I did so, the float had totally disappeared,
and the rod itself, though heavy enough to
my notions, seemed suddenly endowed with the
power of locomotion, and was walking away into
the water. One dart forward, and I caught it, just
as it was pitching over, but it had been nearly tugged
out of my hand again ere I had got it fast. With
triumph and with joy I found that there must be a
fish at the end of the line, and a large one. I had
caught gudgeons enough in my day, but I had no
notion how to manage a large fish now I had hooked
him. The only art I had was to pull away, and perhaps
it was quite as lucky as not; for had the united
strength of myself and the fish been superior to that
of the line, the latter must have given way. But as
it was, the fish was somewhat exhausted by his first
tugs at the rod, and he suffered me very quietly to
draw him in within a few yards of the shore.
Luckily the line, though twisted round the top of
the rod, was carried down to my hand, though
without any reel; but there were some twenty or
thirty yards of line wound upon a piece of stick beyond
my hands. Luckily I say, for just as I was
pulling my captive on, and could catch a sight of his
glorious bulk, he seemed to me to put his tail in his
mouth, and then with a great spring darted rapidly
away. The top of the rod broke through in a moment,
and the line ran through my hands like a knife.
I caught it on the winder, however, and checked
my enemy in his course. He gave a sulky tug or
two, but then suffered me to pull him in again, and
a desperate struggle we had of it when he found
himself once more coming near the bank. When I
found I could not manage him, I gave him line off
my hands; and then refreshed, though with a heart
I am ashamed to say beating how fast, I hauled
away, and joyfully found his resistance diminishing.
It was the labor of nearly an hour, however, before I
got him close up to the bank, and then twice he got
away from me, once, nearly bringing me into the
water by the sudden dart he gave as I kneeled down
to lift him on shore. At length, however, I landed
him safely, and judge of my joy when I beheld a
trout weighing five pounds at least, and magnified
by my imagination to ten or fifteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had got the hook quite down into his throat,
which probably was the secret of my success; for
had it been in his mouth, he and I must have pulled his
jaw off between us. I did not stop even to make an attempt
to take it out, but gathering up the fragments
of my rod, while he lay panting and flapping on the
grass, I lifted him up by the hook and carried him
up triumphantly toward the town. I would not go
in through the ordinary gates, however. I believe
it was that a fear seized me lest I should be charged a
duty on my fish; but as the house where I lived was
close to the walls, and had a little garden in one of
the old towers, through which there was a door
and a stone stair-case, I hurried thither, found my
way in by the back-door, and venturing to do what
I had never done before, hurried, uncalled, into the
room of good Father Bonneville at an hour when I
knew he was always at study. Happily it was
Thursday: I knew there was no fish in the house,
and that our dinner, on the following day, was destined
to be pumpkin-soup and a salad. This might
well excuse my presumption, and it did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never in my life did I see a man more delighted
than good Father Bonneville, though he hurried
away a book which he had been reading when I
came in—I believe it was the Old Testament—as if
there had been something very shameful in it. He
admired the trout immensely, looked at it on one
side and then on the other, declared it the finest
trout he had ever seen, and patting me on the head,
asked me if I had really caught that all by myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I assured him that I had had no help whatever,
and then added, slyly, “You know it is Friday to-morrow,
Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my son, my son,” he replied, with a rueful
shake of the head but a smile upon his lips, “we
must not think too much of improving our fare, especially
on meagre days; but the fish is a very fine
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
fish notwithstanding, and we will have it for dinner
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have dwelt long upon this little incident; for it
was a very important one in my eyes at the time,
and was not altogether without its influence upon
my life. But I shall only pause to state here that
Father Bonneville made more of me from that time
forth than he had ever done before. Previously he
had contented himself by giving me my lessons
daily, by speaking a few kindly words to me at meal
times, and turning me over for the rest of the day to
his good old housekeeper. Now, however, I seemed
to be fit for something better. Father Bonneville
was very fond of fish, as most priests are, and every
Tuesday and Thursday evening I was down at the
banks of the lake or of the river; and as I had great
perseverance, and rapidly became skillful, Father
Bonneville very rarely went without fish of some
kind for his dinner on Wednesdays and Fridays, so
that fasting became somewhat of a farce—except in
Lent indeed—except in Lent, when he made tremendous
work with us.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A PRIEST’S HOUSEHOLD.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I must give my pictures of the early part of my
life, detached and phantasmagoria-like as they appear
to the eye of memory. But yet I will supply
as far as possible any links of connection which are
afforded by that power which is to memory what
the second rainbow, which we sometimes see, is to
the first—the reflection of a reflection—I am not quite
sure that that is philosophical—but it is a figure, and
it is pretty—so let it stand, it will do for Boston—the
power I speak of is commonly termed reminiscence—a
shadow of remembrance which overtops the
mountain, and is seen indistinctly after the prototype
has sunk behind the steep—God bless me, I am getting
into Boston again. Well, upon my life I will
be sober, notwithstanding the sixteen gallon act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The catching a fish was my first great exploit in
life, and I could evidently see that Father Bonneville
paused and pondered over it, as was his character;
for he was a very considerate and thoughtful
man, by no means without powers of observation,
and a great habit of reasoning <span class='it'>a priori</span>, which sometimes
misled him a little. He made me tell him the
whole story of the catching of the fish, and of how I
had managed it. You may judge I dilated not a
little, partly from the interest of the subject to myself,
and partly from the difficulty which every child,
and every novelist in three volumes, finds in clothing
his thoughts in brief language. I found afterward
that he had deduced his own conclusions from premises
which I had afforded; and I am happy to say
they were all favorable to me. He had deduced, I
learnt, from my catching the rod before it fell into
the water, that I possessed considerable quickness
and presence of mind. He had inferred from the
fact of my having got the line through my hands before
I attempted to strain the rod, that there was a
great deal of cautiousness and foresight in my disposition;
and by the pains I had taken, and the labor I
had undergone, without flinching, or growing rash
or angry, he was led to believe that I was of a most
persevering, undaunted, and resolute disposition. In
a word, he learned to think me a being more deserving
of care and cultivation than he had previously
imagined; that I was not a mere baby to be taught
his A B C in any science, and that there was a soil,
beneath the green freshness of my youth, which
might be cultivated to great advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But let us give a slight sketch of the good Father,
as he sat with his little tight-fitting black cap upon
his head, looking like one half of a negro melon.
The dress was insignificant—mean—out of the way,
which is worse. The plain cassock and bands, the
scapulary and the cross, and the grand three-cornered
hat, had not surely much to recommend the individual
member of the profession. There was no
trickery of dress. There was no superfluous ornament.
Even the assumption of manner was repressed,
and, as far as I can recollect, he always
seemed to remember sensitively, that a priest in the
chair or the confessional derived whatever authority
he possessed from a higher source, which conferred
none upon him as an individual. The reverse of
this feeling is the crying sin of the priesthood of all
the creeds I know, and especially of his own. Most
men would listen reverently to the expounders of
God’s will, when they are expounding his will, if
they would not carry their <span class='it'>cathedra</span> into the drawing-room
or the parlor with them. It is very wise, indeed,
to make a marked distinction between the
minister and the man, and still more wise to make a
marked distinction between the functions of the
minister and the man; for where the two are
blended together—either through the stupidity of the
people or the arrogance of the priest—it will be found
nine times out of ten that the weaknesses of the man
(not to notice vices or crimes) overwhelm the qualities
of the teacher. Amongst a nation, indeed, who,
as a nation, acknowledge no authority but themselves,
either in matters civil, politic or religious—where
every man is at liberty to set up his own little
God Almighty in his garden, and to worship him
after what fashion he pleases—this distinction is not
so necessary; for each minister being chosen by the
flock which he has to instruct, must know beforehand
tolerably well what is the sort of pabula best
suited to their palates, while the flock, on their part,
having chosen their man, with their eyes very wide
open, must either stultify themselves, or cry him up
as one of the bright lights of the age. If not, why
did they choose him to light them? They become
as much interested in his personal as in his public
character—for it is very disagreeable for an elder of
a congregation, unless he have some personal quarrel
with his dear friend, the minister, to lay his hand
upon his heart and say, “I have been grievously
mistaken”—and many a small offense—nay, many a
great one in the pastor is smoothed over and polished
with the varnish-vanity of a loving congregation,
who adore themselves in the minister they have selected,
and even in the very church are worshiping
themselves, in him, instead of the Deity. Of all
sorts of idolatry in the world—and there are many—surely
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
the worst in the eyes of a pure Being must
be self idolatry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have strayed from my subject; but a bold leap,
and we are back again. See him there, sitting in his
easy arm-chair, with the little black cap upon his
head, to cover the work of time rather than the
ravages of the razor, with the soft, silky locks, now
almost snow-white, floating from underneath it, and
the dark garments, never laid aside except when at
rest, enveloping the whole figure. Yet what an air
of calm and tranquil dignity in the very disposition
of that figure, and in that mild, benignant face.
Where are the cares and sorrows of life? What
have anxious thought, and the arduous duties, well
performed, of a laborious profession done in this
case? Where are the pangs, the sicknesses, the
wasting force of disease, the corporeal pains, the uneasy
weakness of senility? They are not there.
He rests in his chair as easily as a child—ay, and as
gracefully too. Oh, the balm, the blessed balm,
such as Gilead never knew, of a pure, high, and
holy heart, which, preserving and refreshing continually
the spirit that dwells within it, with that aromatic
odor of the tree of life, imparts a portion of
the sovereign antidote even to the frail form of clay,
and guards it against the shock of time, or the wearying
war of circumstances! Few of the impatient,
the irritable, the passionate, the children of caprice,
the slaves of vice, the hunters of excitement, ever
see the age to which Father Bonneville had already
attained, and those who do, reach it enfeebled, worn
out, toil-broken, and shriveled up by the struggles,
and the wanderings, and the difficult passes, and the
burning suns, which they themselves have sought
and found upon the way. Father Bonneville’s had
been a quiet and a placid life—I know nothing of his
history—I never heard it—but the part I speak of
was written on his face. Father Bonneville’s had
been a quiet and a placid life—I am quite sure of it:
otherwise he could have never lived to be the calm,
happy, benignant old man he was at sixty-three.
On his face you hardly saw his age; for it was as
smooth as a boy’s, but those white hairs, and the
necessity of using spectacles now and then, betrayed
the fact that he was not quite so young as he once
had been. His teeth—I recollect them as they were
even then, quite well—were beautifully white and
even, but the old man used to say, that though he
hoped his tongue was true, his mouth was an artful
hypocrite; for it put its best arguments forward,
and kept all that were worthless and unserviceable
behind; in other words, that the front teeth might
be good enough, but that those hard-working slaves
of the stomach, the grinders, were gone—and this
was, probably, the cause of his love of fish. Heaven
bless the finny fellows! they are seldom, any of
them, tough, and the worst one has to fear is a bone
or an indigestion; though it is rather hard, I think,
to be pulled out of a fresh stream, and put upon a
gridiron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville was a very learned man, too,
as well as a good one. He had read very much, for
he had much leisure; had studied many languages
and many things, and moreover had reasoned upon
what he studied. All this I found out afterward;
for at the time I speak of, though he made a point
of instructing me himself every day, the store of
erudition required for my mental food was but small.
His lessons were given in a very different way from
any other lessons that I ever received or ever heard
of. He would sit down and open a book, and then
begin to talk to me upon some apparently indifferent
subject; but somehow before five minutes had
passed, he had always contrived to bring the conversation
round to something which the book contained,
or which it explained, or which it elucidated.
Then we would read a sentence or two, and then
pause, and comment, and converse, sometimes remarking
the language, and the niceties of style and
grammar, sometimes dwelling upon the thoughts expressed
or the facts related. It is wonderful how
this course impressed every thing upon my mind.
All that I read seemed to be surrounded by a sort of
artificial memory; for every word was connected
with these conversations, and the one always served
to bring the other to remembrance. It took a little
longer time, it is true; I read one page of Cæsar
where another boy might read two; but I both remembered
and understood what I had read, and possibly
the other might not; nor am I at all sure that
I did not make as much progress in the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where I got the first rudiments of education I do
not know; for I cannot remember the period that I
could not read or write, when I could not add up a
sum with tolerable exactness, or draw helmets,
and swords, and battle-axes, and very ugly faces,
and men with enormous pig-tails, on the first leaf
of a spelling-book. I have a faint idea that I was
very ill when I first came to the house of Father
Bonneville, and that illness may probably be the sort
of gauze curtain which hangs between the eye of
memory and the period antecedent, not altogether
hiding the figures beyond, but rendering them confused
and indistinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having said thus much of my kind friend and preceptor,
I must take some notice of the other tenant—the
only other tenant of the house. This was the
good priest’s housekeeper, who was probably some
four or five years older than himself; but yet as busy,
bustling, active a little body as ever was seen, doing
every thing and trying to do more. What were the
qualities for which Father Bonneville originally
chose her to superintend his domestic affairs, I really
do not know; but it certainly was not for her beauty—perhaps
it might be for the reverse. Nature intended
evidently, at first, to cast her in what I may
call the pippin-headed mould; for her head was as
round as a ball, furnished with two eyes like sloes,
and not much larger; but by some freak of nature, the
nose had been infinitely projected. It always seemed
to me as if her parents, or nurses, had been in the
custom of lifting her up by it, as a sort of handle,
and it certainly had not decreased in volume in latter
life. She was a little woman too, hardly fitted to
carry such a burden, but strong, well-formed, and
neither lean nor fat. Her excellent health and spirits,
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
she attributed to never having drunk any cider,
though she had lived in the cider provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” she said, “I always knew better than
that, if cider is dear at three sous, wine is cheap at
ten. It is not much of either that I drink, as heaven
knows and Father Bonneville, but when it is not
water, it shall be wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must point out to the reader more particularly
her manner of connecting heaven and Father Bonneville
together; for it was very characteristic of her
mind, and she did it on all occasions. Indeed the
two ideas seemed so intimately blended in her mind
that they could never be separated. She was a good
creature as ever lived, and looked up to all that was
good, and it is probable that as, in her humility, she
put both heaven and Father Bonneville very, very
far above herself indeed, the two objects got confounded
in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a very good creature indeed, as I have
said, and oh, how I used to teaze her! She bore it
with wonderful patience and good humor, sometimes
laughing with me, sometimes laughing at me, sometimes
affecting to be very angry, but still mending
my clothes, setting my little room to rights, giving
me any good thing she could lay her hands upon, and
showing me all the kindness and tenderness of a mother.
I am afraid, however, that there was a more
serious storm than usual brewing about the period I
speak of; for I not only continued to teaze poor Jeanette
with my boyish fun, but I had added a great
deal to her labors and embarrassments by leaving fish-hooks,
and bits of line, and broken rods—some of the
fish-hooks covered with worms too, in her kitchen,
and her pantry, and the most sacred places of her
own particular domain. But just at that time, came
the catching of the trout I have mentioned, and that
immediately cured all grievances. Not that I mean
to say, that the good woman was moved by any peculiar
passion for fish herself; for she would not
have deprived Father Bonneville and me of a morsel
of it for the world, but from that moment she became
aware that there was some utility in fish-hooks—that
they were made for some other purpose than running
into her hands, or littering her table. I provided in
short something which could gratify the good Father’s
taste, and that was quite sufficient apology for
all offenses in the eyes of his worthy housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these two, such as I have depicted them, I
passed several years of my early life. I must have
been about nine when I caught the trout, and if I
ever had been a weak or sickly boy, I certainly was
so no longer. I could not have been ten, I am sure,
and I must have been there at this time for some
years—sufficient at least to let the memory of
other scenes fade away. My time passed sweetly
and pleasantly. I had plenty of wholesome food.
I had exercise for the mind and exercise for the
body. Quiet and still, the place certainly was.
Amusements, for persons of my age, there were
none in the town itself, except when there was some
great Church fete, or when some Italian led through
the town a bear or a monkey, or carried a marmot,
or an instrument of music, and when once in the
year the great fair took place, which brightened up
the town for three whole days. Nevertheless, I was
very contented. I loved Father Bonneville sincerely.
I loved good Jeanette, too, sincerely; but with
another sort of love—rather, I suspect, with that peculiar
kind of affection with which a child regards a
doll, the head of which has been knocked upon the
door till it has neither nose nor eyes. Assuredly I
had not deprived the good housekeeper of those serviceable
features, but I had misused her tenderness,
and teazed her till I loved devotedly that which I
teazed. I loved them both, then, and well I might;
for two better people never existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader, perhaps, may ask, “are we to have
nothing but good people in this book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let him wait a little. We shall find their foil presently,
and pray do not let any one fall into the mistake
of supposing that there is any thing inherently
monotonous in goodness. Far from it. It has as infinite
variety as evil. Its scope is as extensive, from
the most sublime deed of devotion or self-sacrifice,
to the smallest act of kindness. Nay, it is more vast
than evil; for I cannot but think that goodness embraces
all things, while evil only touches a part. It
is because the mind of man is too small to comprehend
the magnitude of goodness that he fancies it limited,
as a child gazing at the sky, thinks that there
is a blue wall to space. It is because his mind is too
dim and feeble, too much accustomed to struggle
with impurer things, that he cannot reach its heights
or penetrate its depths, and conceive the infinite
variety it affords. The salmon can leap up the cataract,
or dart against the current of the turbid stream,
but he cannot soar into the sky like the eagle, and at
one glance take in a world below. The most sublime
thing in the whole universe is goodness, and it
is the sweetest too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happy, right happy do I believe myself to have
been thus, in youth, associated with two such good
and kindly beings. At that period of life, the plastic
nature of the child receives, in a great degree, its future
shape and form. The impressions are deep, and,
once hardened, ineffaceable: the character receives
its bent, the mind its tone and coloring, and although
I may have done many things in life which I regret,
and which they could not have approved, yet their
goodness has been always in my memory as a light-house
to show me the way across the dark and
struggling waters of life, and to welcome me home
to port, however far I may have wandered astray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot conceive any greater blessing can be bestowed
on youth than the companionship of the
really good. I speak not of the stiff and rigid. I
speak not of the harsh and the severe. I speak not
even of the self-denying, the sober, and the circumspect.
The example of anchorite or puritan, never
effected much upon the heart of youth. But I speak
of the really good, and they are not good if they are
not gentle; for the reverse of gentleness is wrong.
I speak of the good who learn from the fountain of
all goodness to be happy, and to make happy; and
who know that it is part of the commandment, to
enjoy.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>THE FIRST ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most remarkable epochs of a man’s life
is when he first begins to think. Philosophers suppose—at
least many have supposed—that what is
called thinking, goes on from birth, or very nearly so;
but either this is a mistake, or they and I are talking
of different things. What I mean by thinking is not
the process of putting two or three ideas together,
which commences with a child as soon as it has two
or three ideas to put, but an operation of the mind, in
which all the mind’s servants are called upon to bear
a part—where imagination comes to aid reason, and
memory and observation bring the materials, and
judgment measures the work. We all must have
felt, in looking back upon our past life, that there has
been a certain period at which flood-gates, as it were,
have been opened suddenly, and a torrent of thought
has flowed in upon us. The period itself will generally
be somewhat indefinite to remembrance; for
we none of us mark this new thing at the time that
it occurs. We feel—we know—we enjoy; but we
do not sit down to chronicle the moment when the
new world of thought burst upon our sight. All any
man can say, is, “About such and such a time, I
began to think”—he generally adds, “deeply”—to
contrast that period, with the period of <span class='it'>impression</span>
gone before, which he confounds with <span class='it'>thought</span>.
In fact it may be very difficult—for I do not wish to
dogmatize—to say where thought exactly begins,
and mere reception of idea, in either a simplex or a
complex form, ends. It may be that thought is as a
mighty stream, beginning in a very minute rill; but
there certainly is one place where the river suddenly
swells tremendously. I cannot say that I thought
much, if at all, on any subject till I was more than
ten years old. In conversing with Father Bonneville,
who tried hard to teach me to think without
appearing to do so, my answers were more pictures
of my impressions than of my thoughts; but about
twelve years old, thought began to come upon me
fast and strong. I can remember quite well many a
time, on the Tuesday and Thursday evenings, in
the spring time of the year, sitting by that little lake,
or wandering by the banks of the river, and falling
into deep and even sombre reveries, in the course
of which I tried every thing that I had learned or
knew, by faculties which seemed to have sprung
up suddenly within me. The world seemed full of
wonders that I had never seen before, and I began to
take interest in things which before had been to me
flat and unprofitable enough. It was not alone the
aspect of nature, the lake, the stream, the wood,
the field, the rock, the mountain, the blue sky,
the passing cloud, the rising and setting sun, the
wandering moon, or the bright eyes of the twinkling
stars, nor the flowers and shrubs, nor the birds of the
bough and sky, nor the beasts of the field and plain,
that gave me matter for thought, but man came in
for his share, and man’s doings—and I am afraid
woman’s, too. I would listen to the political talk of
the day, which, God help me, I had cared naught
about before, although there were events passing
which influenced the fate of even children. I would
hear of the strife of parties, and of the rise of new
opinions, which shook the world to its foundation,
and I would marvel and wonder at all I heard, and
meditate over it in my solitary seat by the lake. If
I could not understand, it mattered not; the subject
was all the more a plea for revery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not help remarking likewise, that Father
Bonneville was a good deal affected by the tidings
which arrived from time to time. He became very
thoughtful, too—nay, very sad. There was a look
of anxiety—of apprehension—about him. His cheerful
moments were few, and he would often shake his
head slowly in melancholy guise, and sigh profoundly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One little circumstance, which occurred at this
time, gave me cause to think that the good Father,
besides his general regret for various violent scenes
which were occurring at the time, had some cause
for personal dread. I have mentioned that he was
well acquainted with several languages, and from
the earliest period I can recollect he had read with
me at least one page of English every day. It was
our custom, too, to frequently talk in English. How
I first learned the language I do not know, but it
seemed to me then, as I am now well aware is the
case, that I spoke it with more ease and fluency than
he did, though, perhaps, with not so much accuracy.
At the period I am speaking of, however, he discontinued
our English readings, and I could perceive
that all the English books had been put away out of
sight. Moreover, he gave me a hint that it might
be better not to converse in English any more, for a
little time at least; and though I sometimes forgot
myself, I obeyed his injunctions tolerably well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this gave me matter for thought, and now the
stream and the tank were not sufficient for me. I
must walk far away into the woods: and I fancy that
my long absence, even in my play hours, gave some
uneasiness to the good priest. He was fond of taking
me with him through the streets of the town, and
thus detaining me from my solitary walks, when at
length he began to doubt whether the town or the
country was the best school for my leisure hours. I
remember on one occasion, when he went to visit a
man of the parish, who was lying sick, though not mortally
ill, he made me go with him, and after keeping
me some ten minutes in the house, we took our way
back again, passing across the market-square. A
number of men with bare arms were busily engaged
in the middle of the open space erecting a curious-looking
instrument, consisting of a little platform, and
some raised pieces of timber, the use of which I
could not conceive. A little crowd of men, women,
and boys were gathered together round—and I would
fain have stood and gazed likewise. But Father Bonneville
hurried silently on, with his eyes bent upon
the ground. It was not till I plucked him by the
<span class='it'>soutane</span>, and pointing to the spot, asked what that
could mean, that he took any notice of what was going
on. I could see his face turn a shade paler, and he
gave a slight shudder as he replied, “mean, my son?—that
is the guillotine.” Without another word he
pursued his way, and I accompanied him. On the
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
following day I heard from good Jeanette, that a man
was to be executed at noon; and I confess I had the
strongest inclination in the world to go and see. The
desire arose from no cruelty of disposition—no taste
for blood—but it arose in mere curiosity. Youth
very seldom attaches any definite idea to death. It
is an acquired dread that death inspires. Others
tell us about its being terrible, till we become convinced
it is so; and the sight of the dying or the
dead fixes the gloomy terror forever in our minds.
No one had ever talked to me about death at this
time; and in wishing to go to the execution, it was
with no desire to see a man die, and still less suffer.
I only looked upon him as a person about to exhibit
himself in new and strange circumstances, and a
rope-dancer or a conjuror would have answered my
purpose quite as well—perhaps better. However, I
was not destined that day to see one or the other.
Long before noon, Father Bonneville ordered the
windows to be shut up, as if there were a death in
the house. He staid at home himself, and passed
the time in prayer, in which Jeanette and I joined
him; after which he read two penitential sermons as
soon as he thought the execution was over, and then
ordered the windows to be opened again, after a new
rush of feet past the house had announced to us
that the blood-loving populace were going down to
the suburbs at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If good Father Bonneville had kept up the same
practice, his house would have been shut up, before
long, five days out of seven in the week, and his
domestic prayers would have occupied at least one-quarter
of his whole time. Executions became
numerous, agitation of the public mind, disquietude,
tumult, violence, followed rapidly. No man felt
himself safe: every one dreaded his neighbor; each
hour had its peril; the meanest act of life became of
consequence. There was no free-hearted easiness,
no social cheerfulness; all the amenities of life were
banished, till despair supplied a gayety of a chilly
and a death-like sort, to cast an unwholesome blaze
upon the darkening times like the lights that flit
about the graves of the dead. The spirits and the
energies of Father Bonneville fell completely for a
time. He a good deal neglected my instruction during
a couple of months—strove to give it, but could
not fix his attention. At other times when I was
not sitting with him, I was left to do much as I
pleased, and my wanderings were now prolonged.
Sometimes I would extend them five or six miles
beyond the foot of the hill, especially toward the
north and west, where a number of objects of great
interest, as they seemed to me, lay concealed in the
depths of a country, not fully populated and very
little explored by the traveler. There was a curious
old house there, completely in ruins—nothing in fact
but the shell—with the doors gaping like dead men’s
jaws, and the windows mere eyeless sockets. The
outside, however, had once been very beautiful,
richly arabesque, and ornamented with small pillars
of a dark-gray marble, in a style which, I believe,
belonged to the early part of the fifteenth century.
The interior was crowded with young trees, rooted
amongst fragments of decaying joists and roofing,
while the windows were all trailed over with brambles
and self-sown climbers. The jackdaws nested
in the tall towers, and the owls slept till nightfall in
the undisturbed chimney; but the social swallows
built no habitations beneath those eves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farther on, there was an older building still,
mounted on its little rock, with a small, but deep
tank on one side, a river on the other, and a foss
once traversed by a drawbridge, running round the
rest of the base, and joining the river at the pond. I
once waded through the stream, for the drawbridge
had long returned to dust, to see what was in the
house above. I was ill repaid for my pains. All
was vacant and in ruin. There was a large, tall,
square building, two lesser towers and a wall, but
not a vestige of wood-work remaining. It must have
been long completely dilapidated; for in the great-court,
with one of its gnarled roots knotted round a
fragment of masonry, was an oak which must have
taken more than two centuries to grow. The two
buildings were strangely contrasted in style: the gay,
airy lightness of the one: the stern, heavy simplicity
of the other, were the records of two past ages; but
they, the ages which brought them forth, the people
which had built them, and the feelings which lent
them their characteristics, had all passed away.
The epitaph for the grave-yard of all terrestrial things
should have been written on both their fronts—“<span class='it'>Fuimus</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one day in the autumn time, when the
leaves were brown, and the light mellow, and the
birds had ceased their song, but the grasshopper still
prolonged his chirping, that I had wandered out in
this direction an hour or two after noon. It is a very
pleasant land that Antoumois—for I am certain that
it was there, although I have no proof of it—with its
vineyards and its corn-fields, and its woods interspersed,
and here and there wild, ill-shapen rocks
starting up in one’s way, and presenting strange, unusual
forms and clefts and caverns innumerable.
There had been a good deal of rioting in the town
in the morning. In fact the regular municipal government
might have been considered as almost at an end,
and anarchy was advancing with rapid strides. I no
longer wanted to see executions: the turbulence of
the people did not amuse and did not frighten me, but it
annoyed me. My ears were tired of shouts and
screams, and I was sick of the Marseillaise to my
very heart. I longed to see the old town in its clear,
calm, sober light again, with the streets uncrowded
by victims, and unpolluted by the disorderly rabble
of the suburb. Gladly I escaped out into the country,
and I believe good Father Bonneville was glad
to see me go. I had walked on past the first house
I have mentioned, and was about mid-way between
it and the second. I was wandering on along a little
foot-path, not sufficiently frequented to prevent the
velvet moss from growing quickly upon it, and had
very nearly arrived at a spot where one of those
bold, rugged and fissured rocks which I have mentioned,
rose up in the midst of the wood, and forced
the path to take a turn. Suddenly, when near the
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
angle, a woman and a child turned the corner advancing
with wild and rapid steps. The child, a
beautiful little girl, of some seven years old, dressed
in a costume of the higher classes, but with nothing
but her own beautiful curly hair upon her head, was
crying bitterly. The woman—evidently a lady of
some rank and station—shed no tears; but there was
a look of wild, anxious terror, almost amounting to
frenzy, on her face. The moment she beheld me
she started back, dragging the child with her, and
uttering a low scream. But an instant’s thought
made her pause again; and she fixed her deep, inquiring
eyes upon me when she saw that I was but
a boy and alone. She was very beautiful, though
very pale, and her face was in some way familiar
to me. As I gazed at her with some surprise, and
not untouched by the fear which she evidently felt
herself, I saw that various parts of her dress were
dyed and dabbled with blood. I had stopped when
she stopped, and remained somewhat bewildered
while she fixed upon me that earnest, penetrating
look. Suddenly, some thought or remembrance
seemed to strike her, and letting go the child’s hand,
she darted forth and grasped my arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are not you the boy whom I saw some months
ago at Father Bonneville’s?” she asked in a low and
hurried voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I live with him, madam,” I replied; “but what
blood is that upon your dress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband’s,” replied the lady, in a tone so
low, so icy, so full of deep despair that it seemed to
freeze my very heart. “They have just murdered
him before my very face, because he would not give
them powder when he had none to give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she put her hand to her head for a few moments,
and the little girl, still weeping bitterly, crept
up to her side, and took hold of her gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” said the lady, disengaging the child’s
hand and putting it in mine, “take her to Father
Bonneville—tell him what has happened—beseech
him to keep her in safety for two or three months.
I will come and claim her if I live so long. If not,
let him send her to England and think me dead. You
will take care of her—you will be kind to her—you
will guide her safely?” and she fixed her large,
dark eyes full upon me, seeming to look into my
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had taken little notice of the child, who was
now crying more bitterly than ever, and murmuring
that she would not go. For my part, I promised all
that she desired, but she hardly listened to me, exclaiming,
almost immediately I began to speak—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay! she must have some means. Here, here,”
and she took from her pocket two rolls of coin,
wrapped up in paper as was much the custom in
France in those days. One of these she gave to me,
enveloped and sealed as it was. The other, she
broke as one would break a stick, and I perceived it
contained louis-d’ors, by one of them falling out upon
the ground. I stooped to pick it up, but she said in
the same hurried tone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, never mind. Speed is worth all
the gold in the world. Here, take this half and go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then stooping down, she kissed the little girl a
hundred times, pressed her to her heart, laid her
hand upon her head and looked up to heaven; and
now the tears fell plentifully. From time to time,
however, she whispered a few words in the child’s
ear, and they seemed to have a great effect. She
wept still, and somewhat clung to her mother; but
when, at length, the lady replaced the child’s hand
in mine, saying, “Now go, go, and God Almighty
be your God and Protector,” she made no further
resistance; but with bent head, and eyes dropping
fast, ran on beside me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly I heard a voice cry, “Stop, stop!” and
turning round, saw the lady running fast after us.
She caught the child’s hand and mine with a quick,
eager grasp, and looked up on high, seeming to consider
something deeply, and I could see the pulse
beating in her beautiful neck with fearful force. At
length, however, she dropped our hands with a deep,
heavy sigh, and murmured, “They will never hurt
two children—surely, they will not hurt two children.
Go on—go on—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned sadly away, and walking on, I was
there in the forest leading the little girl by the hand,
and with a walk of more than four miles before
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>That’s</span> a smart little fellow of yours,” said a
gentleman named Winslow to a laboring man, who
was called in, occasionally, to do work about his
store. “Does he go to school?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, sir,” replied the poor man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not, Davis? He looks like a bright lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got good parts, sir,” returned the father,
“but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what?” asked the gentleman, seeing that
the man hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Times are rather hard now, sir, and I have a
large family. It’s about as much as I can do to
keep hunger and cold away. Ned reads very well,
writes a tolerable fair hand, considering all things,
and can figure a little. And that’s about all I can
do for him. The other children are coming forward,
and I reckon he will have to go to a trade
middling soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old is Ned?” inquired Mr. Winslow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s turned of eleven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wont put him to a trade before he’s thirteen
or fourteen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t keep him home idling about all that time,
Mr. Winslow. It would be his ruination. It’s young
to go out from home, I know, to rough it and tough
it among strangers”—there was a slight unsteadiness
in the poor man’s voice—“but it’s better than
doing nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned ought to go to school a year or two longer,
Davis,” said Mr. Winslow, with some interest in
his manner. “And as you are not able to pay the
quarter-bills, I guess I will have to do it. What say
you? If I pay for Ned’s schooling can you keep
him at home some two or three years longer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t expect <span class='it'>that</span> of you, Mr. Winslow,” said
the poor man, and his voice now trembled. He uncovered
his head as he spoke, almost reverently.
“You aint bound to pay for schooling my boy. Ah,
sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you havn’t answered my question, Davis.
What say you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, sir, if you are really in earnest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am in earnest. Ned ought to go to school. If
you can keep him home a few years longer I will
pay for his education during the time. Ned”—Mr.
Winslow spoke to the boy—“what say you? Would
you like to go to school again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, sir,” quickly answered the boy,
while his bright young face was lit up with a gleam
of intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you shall go, my fine fellow. There’s the
right kind of stuff in you, or I’m mistaken. We’ll
give you a trial at any rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winslow was as good as his word. Ned was
immediately entered at an excellent school. The
boy, young as he was, appreciated the kind act of
his benefactor, and resolved to profit by it to the full
extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made an investment of ten dollars to-day,” said
Mr. Winslow, jestingly to a mercantile friend, some
three months after the occurrence just related took
place, “and here’s the certificate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held up a small slip of paper as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten dollars! A large operation. In what
fund?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A charity fund.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” And the friend shrugged his shoulders
“Don’t do much in that way myself. No great
faith in the security. What dividend do you expect
to receive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know. Rather think it will be large.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better take some more of the stock if you think
it so good. There is plenty in market to be bought
at less than par.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winslow smiled, and said that, in all probability
he would invest a few more small sums in the
same way and see how it would turn out. The little
piece of paper which he called a certificate of stock,
was the first quarter-bill he had paid for Ned’s
schooling. For four years these bills were regularly
paid, and then Ned, who had well improved the opportunities
so generously afforded him, was taken, on
the recommendation of Mr. Winslow, into a large importing
house. He was at the time in his sixteenth
year. Before the lad could enter upon this employment,
however, Mr. Winslow had to make another investment
in his charity fund. Ned’s father was too poor
to give him an outfit of clothing such as was required
in the new position to which he was to be elevated;
knowing this, the generous merchant came forward
again and furnished the needful supply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As no wages were received by Ned for the first
two years, Mr. Winslow continued to buy his clothing,
while his father still gave him his board. On
reaching the age of eighteen, Ned’s employers, who
were much pleased with his industry, intelligence,
and attention to business, put him on a salary of
three hundred dollars. This made him at once independent.
He could pay his own boarding and find
his own clothes, and proud did he feel on the day
when advanced to so desirable a position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How comes on your investment?” asked Mr.
Winslow’s mercantile friend about this time. He
spoke jestingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It promises very well,” was the smiling reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is rising in the market, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any dividends yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
“Oh, certainly. Large dividends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! You surprise me. What kind of dividends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than a hundred per cent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! Not in money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no. But in something better than money.
The satisfaction that flows from an act of benevolence
wisely done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all.” The friend spoke with ill-concealed
contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you call that something?” asked Mr.
Winslow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s entirely too unsubstantial for me,” replied
the other. “I go in for returns of a more tangible
character. Those you speak of wont pay my
notes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winslow smiled, and bade his friend good-morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows nothing,” said he to himself, as he
mused on the subject, “of the pleasure of doing
good; and the loss is all on his side. If we have
the ability to secure investments of this kind, they
are among the best we can make, and all are able to
put at least some money in the fund of good works,
let it be ever so small an amount. Have I suffered
the abridgment of a single comfort by what I have
done? No. Have I gained in pleasant thoughts
and feelings by the act? Largely. It has been a
source of perennial enjoyment. I would not have
believed that, at so small a cost I could have secured
so much pleasure. And how great the good that
may flow from what I have done! Instead of a
mere day-laborer, whose work in the world goes
not beyond the handling of boxes, bales and barrels,
or the manufacture of some article in common use,
Edward Davis, advanced by education, takes a position
of more extended usefulness, and by his higher
ability and more intelligent action in society, will be
able, if he rightly use the power in his hands, to advance
the world’s onward movement in a most important
degree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus thought Mr. Winslow and his heart grew
warm within him. Time proved that he had not
erred in affording the lad an opportunity for obtaining
a good education. His quick mind acquired, in
the position in which he was placed, accurate ideas
of business, and industry and force of character made
these ideas thoroughly practical. Every year his
employers advanced his salary, and, on attaining his
majority, it was further advanced to the sum of one
thousand dollars per annum. With every increase
the young man had devoted a larger and larger proportion
of his income to improving the condition of
his father’s family, and when it was raised to the
sum last mentioned, he took a neat, comfortable new
house, much larger than the family had before lived
in, and paid the whole rent himself. Moreover,
through his acquaintance and influence, he was able
to get a place for his father at lighter employment
than he had heretofore been engaged in, and at a
higher rate of compensation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any more dividends on your charity investment?”
said Mr. Winslow’s friend, about this time.
He spoke with the old manner, and from the old
feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Got a dividend to-day. The largest yet
received,” replied the merchant, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you? Hope it does you a great deal of
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I realize your wish, my friend. It is doing me a
great deal of good,” returned Mr. Winslow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No cash, I presume?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something far better. Let me explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do so, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the particulars of this investment?”
said Mr. Winslow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His friend shook his head, and replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The fact is, I never felt interest enough in
the matter to inquire particulars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well. Then I must give you a little history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know old Davis, who has been working
about our stores for the last ten or fifteen years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My investment was in the education of his son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His father took him from school when he was
only eleven years old, because he could not afford to
send him any longer, and was about putting the little
fellow out to learn a trade. Something interested
me in the child, who was a bright lad, and acting
from a good impulse that came over me at the moment,
I proposed to his father to send him to school
for three or four years, if he would board and clothe
him during the time. To this he readily agreed. So
I paid for Ned’s schooling until he was in his sixteenth
year, and then got him into Webb &amp; Waldron’s
store, where he has been ever since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Webb &amp; Waldron’s!” said the friend, evincing
some surprise. “I know all their clerks very well,
for we do a great deal of business with them. Which
is the son of old Mr. Davis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one they call Edward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that tall, fine-looking young man—their
leading salesman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible! Why he is worth any two clerks
in the store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For his age, there is not a better salesman in the
city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I believe,” said Mr. Winslow, “nor,” he
added, “a better man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know little of his personal character; but, unless
his face deceives me, it cannot but be good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good. Let me say a word about him. The
moment his salary increased beyond what was absolutely
required to pay his board and find such
clothing as his position made it necessary for him to
wear, he devoted the entire surplus to rendering his
father’s family more comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Highly praiseworthy,” said the friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had received, already, many dividends on my
investment,” continued Mr. Winslow; “but when
that fact came to my knowledge, my dividend exceeded
all the other dividends put together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mercantile friend was silent. If ever in his
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
life he had envied the reward of a good deed, it was
at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day,” went on Mr. Winslow, “I have received
a still larger dividend. I was passing along
Buttonwood street, when I met old Mr. Davis coming
out of a house, the rent of which, from its appearance,
was not less than two hundred and twenty-five
dollars. ‘You don’t live here, of course,’ said
I, for I knew the old man’s income to be small—not
over six or seven dollars a week. ‘O, yes I do,’ he
made answer, with a smile. I turned and looked at
the house again. ‘How comes this?’ I asked. ‘You
must be getting better off in the world.’ ‘So I am,’
was his reply. ‘Has anybody left you a little fortune?’
I inquired. ‘No, but you have helped me to
one,’ said he. ‘I don’t understand you, Mr. Davis,’
I made answer. ‘Edward rents the house for us,’
said the old man. ‘Do you understand now?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understood him perfectly. It was then that I
received the largest dividend on my investment
which has yet come into my hands. If they go on
increasing at this rate, I shall soon be rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather unsubstantial kind of riches,” was remarked
by the friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That which elevates and delights the mind can
hardly be called unsubstantial,” replied Mr. Winslow.
“Gold will not always do this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friend sighed involuntarily. The remarks of
Mr. Winslow caused thoughts to flit over his mind
that were far from being agreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year or two more went by, and then an addition
was made to the firm of Webb &amp; Waldron. Edward
Davis received the offer of an interest in the business,
which he unhesitatingly accepted. From that
day he was in the road to fortune. Three years afterward
one of the partners died, when his interest was
increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty-five years from the time Mr. Winslow,
acting from a benevolent impulse, proposed to send
young Davis to school, have passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, about this period, Mr. Winslow, who
had met with a number of reverses in business, was
sitting in his counting-room, with a troubled look on
his face, when the mercantile friend before-mentioned
came in. His countenance was pale and
disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are ruined! ruined!” said he, with much
agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winslow started to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak!” he exclaimed. “What new disaster
is about to sweep over me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house of Toledo &amp; Co., in Rio, has suspended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winslow struck his hands together, and sunk
down into the chair from which he had arisen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it is all over,” he murmured. “All
over!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all over with me,” said the other. “A longer
struggle would be fruitless. But for this I might
have weathered the storm. Twenty thousand dollars
of drafts drawn against my last shipment are back
protested, and will be presented to-morrow. I cannot
lift them. So ends this matter. So closes a business
life of nearly forty years, in commercial dishonor
and personal ruin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you certain that they have failed?” asked
Mr. Winslow, with something like hope in his tone
of voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too true,” was answered. “The Celeste
arrived this morning, and her letter-bag was delivered
at the post-office half an hour ago. Have you received
nothing by her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not aware of her arrival. But I will send
immediately for my letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too true was the information communicated by
the friend. The large commission-house of Toledo
&amp; Co. had failed, and protested drafts had been returned
to a very heavy amount. Mr. Winslow was
among the sufferers, and to an extent that was equivalent
to ruin; because it threw back upon him the
necessity of lifting over fifteen thousand dollars of
protested paper, when his line of payments was
already fully up to his utmost ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly five years, every thing had seemed to
go against Mr. Winslow. At the beginning of that
period, a son, whom he had set up in business, failed,
involving him in a heavy loss. Then, one disaster
after another followed, until he found himself in imminent
danger of failure. From this time he turned
his mind to the consideration of his affairs with more
earnestness than ever, and made every transaction
with a degree of prudence and foresight that seemed
to guarantee success in whatever he attempted. A
deficient supply of flour caused him to venture a
large shipment to Rio. The sale was at a handsomely
remunerative profit, but the failure of his
consignees, before the payment of his drafts for the
proceeds, entirely prostrated him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So hopeless did the merchant consider his case,
that he did not even make an effort to get temporary
aid in his extremity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the friend of Mr. Winslow came with the
information that the house of Toledo &amp; Co. had
failed, the latter was searching about in his mind
for the means of lifting about five thousand dollars
worth of paper, which fell due on that day. He had
two thousand dollars in bank; the balance of the sum
would have to be raised by borrowing. He had
partly fixed upon the resources from which this was
to come, when the news of his ill-fortune arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, it was ruin. Mr. Winslow saw that in a moment,
and his hands fell powerless by his side. He
made no further effort to lift his notes, but, after his
mind had a little recovered from its first shock, he left
his store and retired to his home, to seek in its quiet
the calmness and fortitude, of which he stood so
greatly in need. In this home were his wife and two
daughters, who all their lives had enjoyed the many
external comforts and elegancies that wealth can procure.
The heart of the father ached as his eyes rested
upon his children, and he thought of the sad reverses
that awaited them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On entering his dwelling, Mr. Winslow sought the
partner of his life, and communicated to her without
reserve, the painful intelligence of his approaching
failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
“Is it indeed so hopeless?” she asked, tears filling
her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am utterly prostrate!” was the reply, in a voice
that was full of anguish. And in the bitterness of
the moment, the unfortunate merchant wrung his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Mrs. Winslow, the shock, so unexpected, was
very severe; and it was some time before her mind,
after her husband’s announcement, acquired any degree
of calmness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About half an hour after Mr. Winslow’s return
home, and while both his own heart and that of his
wife were quivering with pain, a servant came and
said that a gentleman had called and wished to see
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” asked the merchant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not understand his name,” replied the servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winslow forced as much external composure
as was possible, and then descended to the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Davis,” he said on entering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Winslow,” returned the visitor, taking the
merchant’s hand and grasping it warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the two men sat down together, the one addressed
as Mr. Davis, said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sorry to learn a little while ago, that you
will lose by this failure in Rio.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavily. It has ruined me!” replied Mr. Winslow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so bad as that I hope!” said Mr. Davis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It has removed the last prop that I leaned
on, Mr. Davis. The very last one, and now the worst
must come to the worst. It is impossible for me to
take up fifteen thousand dollars worth of returned
drafts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen thousand is the amount?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Davis smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is all,” said he, “there is no difficulty in
the way. I can easily get you the money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winslow started, and a warm flush went over
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you come to me,” asked Mr. Davis,
“the moment you found yourself in such a difficulty?
Surely!” and his voice slightly trembled,
“surely you did not think it possible for me to forget
the past! Do not I owe you every thing?—and
would I not be one of the basest of men, if I forgot
my obligation? If your need were twice fifteen thousand,
and it required the division of my last dollar
with you, not a hair of your head should be injured.
I did not know that it was possible for you to get into
an extremity like this, until I heard it whispered a
little while ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So unexpected a turn in his affairs completely unmanned
Mr. Winslow. He covered his face and
wept for some time, with the uncontrollable passion
of a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! sir,” he said at last, in a broken voice, “I
did not expect this, Mr. Davis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had a right to expect it,” replied the young
man. “Were I to do less than sustain you in any
extremity not too great for my ability, I would be unworthy
the name of a man. And now, Mr. Winslow,
let your heart be at rest. You need not fall under this
blow. Your drafts will probably come back to you
to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. To-morrow at the latest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. I will see that you are provided with
the means to lift them. In the meantime, if you are
in want of any sums toward your payments of to-day,
just let me know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can probably get through to-day by my own
efforts,” said Mr. Winslow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably? How much do you want?” asked
Mr. Davis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the neighborhood of three thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will send you round a check for that sum immediately,”
promptly returned the young man, rising
as he spoke and drawing forth his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is nearly two o’clock now,” he added, “so I
will bid you good day. In fifteen minutes you will
find a check at your store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with this Davis retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this, which passed in a brief space of time,
seemed like a dream to Mr. Winslow. He could
hardly realize its truth. But it was a reality, and he
comprehended it more fully, when on reaching his
store, he found there the promised check for three
thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day the protested drafts came in; but,
thanks to the grateful kindness of Mr. Davis, now a
merchant with the command of large money facilities,
he was able to take them up. The friend, before
introduced was less fortunate. There was no
one to step forward and save him from ruin, and he
sunk under the sudden pressure that came upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after his failure he met Mr. Winslow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is this?” said he. “How did you weather
the storm that drove me under? I thought your condition
as hopeless as mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did I,” answered Mr. Winslow. “But, I had
forgotten a small investment made years ago. I have
spoken of it to you before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other looked slightly puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you forgotten that investment in the charity
fund? which you thought money thrown away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Light broke in upon his mind. “You
educated Davis. I remember now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Davis, hearing of my extremity, stepped forward
and saved me. That was the best investment
I ever made!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friend dropped his eyes to the pavement,
stood for a moment or two without speaking, sighed
and then moved on. How many opportunities for
making similar investments had he not neglected!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Last</span> summer I visited, for a few weeks, a romantic
inland town, in the northern part of New England.
While there, some old papers accidentally fell
into my hands, and among them I found the following
story; which appeared to have been thrown
into the form of a legend, and thus handed down
through several generations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The family it relates to were originally among the
principal families residing in the good old town of
Salem, toward the close of the old French war.
No branch of the family remained in the place at
the time of the Revolution of ’76; and their name
even is now forgotten in the vicinity, or only to be
found on some old tomb-stone. This legend served
me to shorten a weary, sultry, mid-summer hour,
and, courteous reader, with the hope that it may do
you the same kind service, I give it to you without
further comment.</p>

<hr class='tbk108'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Fayerweather estate was purchased by the
first of that family who appeared in Salem, of a person
of the name of Boynton. The estate was situated
in that part of Essex street since called “Old
Paved street,” from its having been the first, and
for many years the only one, in the town which
afforded its passengers the convenience of a substantial
stone pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man Boynton, of whom Mr. Fayerweather
purchased the land, was not much respected in the
town; he had but little reputation for honesty; but
Mr. Fayerweather having secured the title deeds,
when he paid down the purchase money, saw but
little reason to fear his title being called in question;
therefore immediately on coming into possession, he
built on it a fine mansion. It was a large and respectable
looking edifice, built in the best style of
the day; its date was the same with that of the
noted one in which the witches were tried, and
which can yet be seen standing in a green old age,
at the corner of North and Essex streets, having
survived the decay and downfall of all its cotemporaries.
The solid beams and rafters of the Fayerweather
mansion might have held together equally
as long, but not many years ago they were ruthlessly
torn down to make room for a more showy house of
bright red brick, built in the modern style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather lived in quiet possession of his
land long enough to see it nearly doubled in value,
by his improvements and the increase of dwellings
in that part of the town. At his decease his only son
took possession of the homestead. Boynton’s death
took place shortly after. And now an unexpected
claim was set up by his son and daughter, Jemmy
and Nanny, to an undivided moiety of the land, in
right of their mother; and a deed was produced by
them, proving their title to this moiety by purchase
in her maiden name, with a date prior to her marriage.
The second Mr. Fayerweather perceived at
once the knavery which had been practiced upon his
father, by the old sinner Boynton; but he not being
able to bring himself to contest the point by a recourse
to law—of which he entertained a horror—Jemmy
and Nanny proceeded to establish their
claim by taking possession. They removed the
little ill-conditioned building which served for their
dwelling, so near the line which separated the garden
and grounds immediately about the mansion,
from the rest of the land, that the hedge of shrubbery
marking the division might conveniently serve them
equally well as an inclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their injured neighbor had no means of redress,
however annoyed; and being of a Christian spirit,
still further subdued by affliction—having lost his
wife and several children in succession—he thought
more of securing possessions in another and better
world, than of resisting encroachments on those remaining
to him in this. Few, however, are the
evils in this life which are found to be wholly unattended
with benefit. Even the fraud of old Boynton,
the aggressions of Jemmy and Nanny, their continual
warfare with the kitchen division of his household,
resulting not seldom in a pitched battle with
broomsticks—even these served a good purpose to
the sorrowing invalid. Like a perpetual blister,
their irritation sometimes aroused his spirit, in danger
of sinking into apathy or dejection; and by
quickening the flow of his blood, and giving it a
more lively action, perhaps produced a favorable
effect upon his health. It is certain that his life was
prolonged to a much greater age than was prophesied
when he took possession of his disputed inheritance.
At his death his estate fell to his son, also an
only one, who in turn became the occupant of the
homestead, and whose family furnishes the principal
subject of the pages which follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather, the third of the name in Salem,
removed from Boston, where he had married and
had resided for several years. He was a man of
great worth, and of good sense, though with some
eccentricities. The handsome property which he
inherited, together with that which fell into his hands
by his marriage, constituted him a wealthy man
without any addition; he, however, engaged in commerce
for a few years, but not finding it to his taste,
he retired from business soon after his removal to
Salem, and led a quiet though useful life; one of the
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
most beloved and respected among the heads of the
town. His good lady was distinguished, principally,
for kindness of heart, and an almost laughable simplicity;
though in her youth she had possessed
much beauty, and of a kind on which Time can
scarce find it in his heart to lay his withering fingers;
spiteful as the old wretch usually is to lilies and
roses and lovely features. This well-matched pair
had but two children—both sons; a niece, however,
left an orphan in infancy was adopted by madam,
(this title, in those days, was always borne by matrons
in the higher station,) and she became equally
beloved by Mr. Fayerweather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy Boynton never married; despairing, probably,
of finding a helpmate equally as saving and
lynx-eyed, as to the main chance as his amiable
sister. Nanny Boynton’s reasons for leading a
single life were never fully known. Perhaps she
never received an offer; though being for many years
reputed the richest heiress in Salem, this does not
seem probable, even had her personal charms not
been quite irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However the case may be, the brother and sister
lived together in much harmony; the fraternal tie
being strengthened by bonds of principal and interest.
Still they were far from being agreeable neighbors
to the family at the larger house, whose quiet they
succeeded in disturbing almost daily. Madam kept
herself as much aloof from them as she could, consistently
with her nature, which was kindly disposed
to every creature that breathed, and led her to do
them all the good in her power. Of this they
availed themselves to their no small profit. They
levied contributions, under the name of loans, upon
her larder, her flour-barrel, and her meat-tub; seldom
replenishing their own scanty stock of provisions,
until a supply from her store-room had served them
a week. The kitchen utensils were in constant requisition.
The servants sometimes took upon them
to resist these exactions, when such a clamor would
be raised, as to throw poor madam into hysterics;
in terror of which and in mercy to his own ears, her
good spouse was fain to give orders that Jemmy and
Nanny should have whatever they asked for, without
contention or debate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was to the unbounded indignation of Aunt
Vi’let; a sable-complexioned dame, who ruled in the
kitchen with despotic sway, and held old Scipio,
her niece Flora, and Peter the footboy, in wholesome
subjection; often extending her dominion to
the parlor, where she found no difficulty in overawing
madam; and even Mr. Fayerweather, though
he sometimes proved refractory, as in the above
instance, yet he generally found it his safest course
to submit in silence to Aunt Vi’let.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there was a being in the world, toward whom
Vi’let bore a decided antipathy, that being was
Nanny Boynton. This antipathy was partly caused
by the conviction that the latter was addicted to
witchcraft; a belief in which, not being yet wholly
dispelled from the minds of the ignorant and uneducated
in Salem. In Vi’let it existed in as full
force as any of the articles of her religious creed; it
might, indeed, be said to be one of them—and her
feelings toward Nanny were governed by it accordingly;
imputing to her agency every untoward event
which occurred in the family generally, but more particularly
her own private mishaps, her ailments and
vexations. No fear, however, found a place in her feelings
toward her enemy; for had the latter attacked her,
backed by him of the cloven foot, in bodily shape,
she was of a temper and spirit to hold her ground
and berate the foul fiend to his face; and if he had
not fairly turned and fled, panic-struck at the torrent
of abuse accompanying her adjurations, he had
proved himself, indeed, a brave spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brawls and disturbances occasioned by the
hostility of these two high-spirited maidens—for
Vi’let too had forsworn matrimony—rendered it
the first object of Mr. Fayerweather’s wishes to remove
the <a id='boyn'></a>Boyntons; and he endeavored to prevail
upon them to relinquish their claim for a reasonable
compensation; but for many years in vain, their residence
in his neighborhood was much too profitable
and convenient for them to be easily induced to
change it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George Fayerweather, the elder of Mr. Fayerweather’s
two sons, being the hero of this legend, it
may be as well to give some account of his boyhood,
especially of those events and associations that had
some share in the formation of his character. Though
in strength and frame a young giant, he had delicate,
handsome features, and a complexion which seemed
to defy the effect of sun or wind, rosy cheeks, and
long, curling, golden hair. He resembled his mother
very much; and madam could not always avoid
betraying her fond pride in this living image of herself,
as she smoothed his hair, and turning each
golden lock over her finger, formed it into ringlets
round his blooming face and ivory throat, after her
daily operations of washing and dressing him.
These offices she took upon herself until he was
eleven years old, and there is no knowing how much
longer she might have chosen to perform them, if
his father had not interfered—“Finding,” as he said,
“the boy was in danger of becoming a conceited,
effeminate coxcomb—which no son of his should be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Mr. Fayerweather was reading in a
small apartment, which opened out of the sitting-room,
formerly used by him as a counting-room, and
still retaining the name, though it might have been
dignified with the title of library, being lined with
book-shelves well filled. The door was half open,
and hearing some one enter the sitting-room, he
looked up and saw his son, who had just undergone
the above-mentioned dressing operations under his
mother’s hands. The boy, not perceiving his
father, went up to the large looking-glass which
hung over the marble slab, where he stood apparently
admiring himself, while he took a handful of
sugar-plums from his pocket, and putting them into
his mouth, ate as he gazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather, with difficulty restraining his
indignation, left the room quietly by another door,
which opened at the foot of the stairs, up which he
went. He descended quickly, bringing a silk gown
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
of his wife’s on his arm, and a lace cap in his hand,
and softly approached George, who was still absorbed
in the contemplation of his own image.
Seizing the boy, who, paralyzed with shame, could
make no resistance, he stripped off his upper garment,
and put the gown and cap on him; then taking
him on his knee, he began to trot and dandle him,
singing, “High diddle diddle.” George’s rage obtained
the mastery; he struggled and kicked with
the strength of a half-grown Hercules, and at length
freeing himself from his father, he stripped off the
gown and stamped upon it—madam’s very blue-watered
tabby! then catching a glance at himself in
the glass, and seeing the cap on his head, he tore it
in two, and flying up to the glass, with one blow of
his fist, broke it into a thousand pieces. The tempest
now subsided in a torrent of tears, and the poor boy
ran off to hide his shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father, when he saw the result of his experiment,
almost repented having carried it so far. He
did not think of the value of the glass, though he
had sent “<span class='it'>home</span>” for it, at the cost of fifty guineas;
and in its elaborately carved and gilded frame, it was
the pride of all “Paved street”; nor madam’s blue-watered
tabby, though it was her fourth best—indeed,
she rather preferred it to her Pompadour lustring,
having an idea that Mr. Fayerweather thought
it becoming to her complexion—the value of these
twice-told he would have thought well-bestowed if
they cured George of his girlish vanity, and called
forth in him a manly spirit; but he regretted having
outraged the feelings of his son. He, however,
courageously repressed the yearning which he felt to
go and soothe the boy and do away the effect of his
severe lesson by sweetmeats and caresses. He
very sensibly left George to himself for a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam was out at this juncture. I pass over her
lamentations, on her return, at the injury done to
her favorite gown and cap, and the still louder ones
which escaped her at the sight of the broken looking-glass;
suffice it to say, that Mr. Fayerweather promised
her a green damask to replace her outraged
tabby, and to send home for a pair of glasses by the
next vessel. George did not make his appearance
at dinner, but his father manfully resisted his inclination
to seek for him, and succeeded in keeping
down madam’s hysterics, by diverting her mind with
some news which he told her relating to the king and
queen. He did not, however, prevent her from
heaping up a plate with every dainty the house
afforded, and giving it to Scipio, with a charge “not
to leave till he had found the child, and made him
eat his dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tea-time came, and no George took his accustomed
seat, as near his mother’s apron-strings as
possible. On the door being opened, however,
which led into the passage between the sitting-room
and kitchen, his voice was heard in pretty loud and
determined tones, and Vi’let expostulating with him;
which somewhat allayed madam’s fears that her pet
had run away and jumped into the river, or had cried
himself sick. The tea-things were cleared away,
but he did not appear. Amy, who had presided at
the tea-table, went to the window and looked out,
thinking her uncle had been almost too hard upon
poor George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near the close of a fine day in mid-winter.
The sun was just setting, and the whole atmosphere
appeared kindled into one bright red flame, giving a
rosy tint to the new-fallen snow, which lay deep
upon the ground, smooth and undrifted, and covering
every roof; while the grotesque figures of the long
icicles which hung from the eaves were glittering
in the ruddy light. The moon’s broad disk was full
in view in the east, but as yet her rays of silver were
lost in the brighter glow of twilight. Amy thought
how pleasant a sleigh-ride would be, if the culprit
could be taken into favor, and they could all go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hour passed without its accustomed cheerfulness
to the family within. Mr. Fayerweather
paced the room, with his hands clasped behind him,
as usual, when his mind was not perfectly at ease.
Madam had taken her knitting, and was seated at
one side of the fire-place, occasionally giving a gentle
sigh; while little John counted his marbles into her
lap, for want of a more convenient place, and missing
his brother very much, but not venturing to ask
why he did not come in. The room was warm from
the fire of hickory which had blazed in the wide
chimney all day, but which was now reduced to a
mass of burning coals covered with white ashes.
This was the hour in which it was customary for
Scipio, preceded by Vi’let as pioneer, to make his
appearance with a log as big as he could lug, to lay
the foundation of the fire for the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some altercation having been heard in the
passage, Vi’let entered alone with a more portentous
scowl than usual, and surveying Mr. Fayerweather
over her spectacles, muttered something which
sounded marvelously like “an old Turk,” and
“folks being in danger of their lives;” then making
a dive into the coals with her huge kitchen-shovel,
she gave a deep sigh, which ended in a grunt, and
continued her grumbling, her last audible words
being “a poor, broken-hearted family.” All this
passed unheeded by them, as “only pretty Fanny’s
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No Scipio followed; but in his stead, in came
Peter, with his milled cap, his striped homespun and
tow apron, carrying a log larger than usual; on seeing
which, Mr. Fayerweather, whose nerves were
still vibrating, broke out in wrath, as the log fell into
the hollow made to receive it by Vi’let, throwing
the coals and ashes far out over the hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peter, how dare you come into the parlor with
the log? Do you not know it is Scipio’s work, you
blockhead? And what did you bring in such a log as
that for? Did you mean to break your back, to save
me the trouble of breaking your head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy turned his face around to Mr. Fayerweather,
who stood aghast at seeing him; for the
streaked and clouded visage which met his view,
did not belong to Peter, but to his own son, who
had involuntarily doffed the milled cap from habitual
reverence as his father spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Mr. Fayerweather, it’s George, if I’m
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
alive!” screamed his mother; “and he has cut off
all his beautiful curls, and his face is all streaked with
I don’t know what! It will never come white
again. What upon earth has got into the boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George was silent for a moment; at length he
muttered, “I don’t mean to be dressed in girl’s
clothes again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, my man,” said his father, speaking
with some difficulty, and shaking his son’s hand,
he continued; “now you make me proud of you;
but you need not wear Peter’s clothes, and you
should not have lifted a log as big as a cider-barrel—it
might have strained your back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s countenance brightened as his father
spoke; at the last words he held his head boldly up
and said, “It did not hurt me at all, sir—I can lift a
log twice as big as that. I mean to bring in all your
wood, to pay for the looking-glass, I—” his lip
quivered, and he could not finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father’s eyes twinkled; he coughed, and
made one or two ineffectual efforts to speak; but all
would not do—and he was obliged to quit the room
precipitately, to hide his emotion. In a moment he
was heard calling out to Scipio, in a voice between
a sob and a shout, to bring out the sleigh;
and now, his eyes dried and his throat cleared, Mr.
Fayerweather was himself again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, my dear,” he said to madam as he returned,
“put on your cloaks, you and Amy, and
we’ll all have a sleigh-ride. There’s the moon
just up, and it will be as light as day; the sleighing
is like glass. George, my man, be quick, and go put
on your own clothes, and wash your face—I intend
you shall drive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sleigh was brought out, and they all got in;
madam and her niece on the back seat, and Mr.
Fayerweather and the two boys on the front, where,
having seen them comfortably seated, well cloaked
and blanketed, their feet at the hot bricks, of which
Vi’let always kept a supply at the kitchen fire,
summer and winter, the reader and I will leave
them, being somewhat in haste to finish this part of
my story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George from this moment put off childish things;
his fair complexion and rosy cheeks became a
source of serious mortification to him; and he endeavored
by exposure to all kinds of weather, to
bring them to a more manly hue. He began now to
mingle with other boys of his age; and the noble and
generous spirit which appeared in him, on every occasion
that could call it forth, rendered him a great
favorite with his companions. The smaller boys
looked up to him as their champion; the weak and
defenseless—as he considered the whole tribe of the
lower animals to be—he took under his especial
protection; and wo to the merciless boy who infringed
on their rights, by depriving them of their
liberty, or by any other act of cruelty toward them
in his sight. His prodigious bodily powers, his
fearlessness and spirit of adventure, made him a
leader in every bold enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is apt to exist, in every town, a rivalry and
jealousy between the inhabitants of different parts;
this spirit was maintained to an unusual degree between
the population of the eastern and western
sections of Salem—the “Down-in-towners” and the
“Up-in-towners,” as they were respectively called.
This feeling displayed itself among the boys particularly,
and on every occasion of their meeting. It
was even said that the flock of geese which led their
goslings to feed in the vicinity of “Broadfield,” and
often breasted the waters of “Mill Pond,” and those
which, more adventurous, dared the waves washing
the “Neck,” often took the field against each other
in hostile array, when dire would be the hissing and
great the loss of feathers. This, however, is not
vouched for; but it is certain that the biped youth
without feathers, had regularly a grand pitched battle
of snow-balls every winter near the first of January;
and the victorious party usually maintained their
superiority for the remainder of the year, and held
possession of the play-ground, then the common,
constituting a kind of border territory, being situated
at nearly an equal distance between the eastern and
western extremities of the town. This common has
since become a fine promenade, shaded with trees,
forming Washington Square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several years the Down-in-towners had been
victorious in the annual fight; probably they being
mostly the sons of sea-faring men, their <span class='it'>bringing-up</span>
had rendered them stronger and more fearless than
the “land-lubbers,” as they called the boys of the
west end. But as soon as George Fayerweather
took the field, the face of affairs was wholly changed;
the foe was routed in every engagement, and the
play-ground was so quietly yielded to the Up-in-towners
at length, that the possession, losing all its
glory, ceased to be an object; and George prevailed
on his band to cede it back to the Down-in-towners,
urging that it properly belonged to them, and that it
was a shame to keep them out of their right. This
trait of magnanimity gained him many friends among
the sons of Neptune at the east end, and finally
brought about a peace between the hostile powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among George’s new acquaintances was one whom
he liked particularly, because he was almost as bold
and fearless as himself; but more especially, because
he had once done him the extraordinary favor of falling
through the ice as they were skating down to
“Baker’s Island,” thereby affording George a glorious
opportunity of showing his prowess in pulling
the lad out of the water at the manifest peril of his
own life. It would be difficult to say which felt the
most obliged on the occasion, George or Dick Seaward;
but the foundation was then laid of a strong
and lasting friendship between the parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About two months after this event Captain Seaward
returned from a long voyage in the Two
Pollys, and Dick lost no time in bringing about an
acquaintance between his father and his friend. The
latter went by special invitation one evening to eat
cocoa-nuts, and see the curiosities which the captain
had brought home. The old salt took a liking to
George at first sight, and, in his rough way, spared
no pains to entertain him. He appeared like some
hero of romance to his wondering guest; and pleased
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
with the lad’s admiration, he ransacked his memory,
stored by voyages of five-and-twenty years, for marvelous
adventures, unheard of perils by shipwreck,
pirates, etc. His narrative, interlarded with high-sounding
and mystic terms, such as “Mawlstroom,”
“Tuffoon,” “Mousoon,” “Kamskeatshy,” and the
“Chainymen,” produced much such an effect on his
hearer’s excited imagination, as Don Quixote might
have experienced at hearing the adventures of
Amadis de Gaul from his own mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain then displayed his curiosities; these
were numerous and strange, and served in some sort
as illustrations of his discourse. There were elephant’s
tusks and ostrich’s eggs, the sword of the
sword-fish, and the saw of the saw-fish; there was
a nautilus’ shell, which might have carried a boat’s
crew; and there was the entire skin of an enormous
snake, which the captain intended to have stuffed and
hung as a capital ornament round the best room.
There was one upon which Mrs. Seaward set an
especial value, it being the first gift the captain had
brought her home, when he was “a courting her.”
This gift of true love was an elephant’s tail, with
about twenty black bristles on it, the size of darning-needles,
and looking like polished whale-bone; but
the one upon which her spouse particularly prided
himself, was the gaping jaw of a monstrous shark,
with its triple row of teeth, suggesting the pleasurable
idea of one’s leg or arm, or half one’s body
serving as a <span class='it'>bonne bouche</span> to the monster. These
treasures were displayed before George’s admiring
eyes, and he looked upon the possessor of them with
a feeling almost amounting to awe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A word or two more regarding these same curiosities:
after being handed down through several
generations, they were among the first deposited in
the Salem Museum upon its being founded; and
they there formed a nucleus, around which has been
gathered, from time to time the present noble collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return to our narrative; when George rose
to take leave at this first visit, the captain, overflowing
with good-will, brought out two cocoa-nuts, a
pine-apple, and a pot of foreign sweetmeats—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, you may stow away these for your
ma’am;” (the pockets were capacious in those days)
“and mind, don’t forget to ax your sir to let you
come down next Wednesday, and you and Dick
may go over the Two Pollys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desired permission being obtained, the two
lads were taken to visit what was nearest to its
proud owner’s heart—after his “old woman and
Dick”—his good vessel the Two Pollys. To describe
George’s ecstasy at the view of the new
world now presented to him would be impossible.
He examined every part of the vessel—let himself
down the sides, and clambered up again—bestrided
the bowsprit—ran up the shrouds—and, before the
captain could call out—“Take care, boy, do you
mean to break your neck!” he was swinging by his
two hands from the top-mast. The frightened seaman
swore a tremendous oath, and threatened the
nine-tails; but by the time George had reached the
deck, which he did in a whole skin, his terror for
the boy’s life was changed into admiration at his
daring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your sir ought to make a sailor of you; it’s a
shame that such a lad as you should be a land-lubber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So thought George, and his resolution was from
this moment taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief part of his time, out of school, was now
spent on board the Two Pollys; and in the course
of a month he was nearly as well acquainted with
every part of the vessel—knew the name of every
mast and sail, of the ropes and the yards, and understood
their management nearly as well as an ordinary
mariner of half a dozen years’ standing. But the
climax to George’s enjoyment was yet to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening his father received a call from Captain
Seaward, accompanied by his son Dick. Mr.
Fayerweather, although somewhat surprised, gave
his guest a very cordial reception, and ordered out
his best wine. The captain took the glass, and after
the accustomed “My sarvice to you,” drank off the
wine and smacked his lips; then clearing his throat
he opened his business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I come to ax a favor of you, Mr. Fayerweather;
d’ye see, Captain Brayton sets sail to-morrow, if
the wind’s fair, on a v’yage to the West Ingees,
and he’ll touch at New York going out, to see a
vessel of his’n, that’s laying there, and only waiting
for his orders to come home. Now, Captain
Bob Stimpson and I, and one or two more of us old
fellows, think of taking the trip with him as far as
New York, and coming back in his vessel. I’m
going to take my boy here with me, and I want you
to let your son George go. I ha’n’t said nothing to
him about it, bethinking myself, as how if you
wa’n’t willing he’d be disappinted, and I knew he
wouldn’t go without your leave, and I’m sure I
shouldn’t think o’ taking him. We expect to be
gone three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather was pleased with the honest
bearing and hearty good-will of his weather-beaten
guest, but he hesitated about letting George go; the
company not being altogether exactly such as he
would have chosen to trust his son with for so long
a time; although all who were named bore the character
of worthy men. He was endeavoring to
frame a refusal that would not wound the captain’s
feelings, when his son entered the room. On hearing
his old friend’s errand from Dick, George expressed
so much delight at the proposed expedition,
that the fond parent prevailed over the prudent one,
and the consent was given. Captain Seaward took
his leave, with a charge to George to be ready by
two o’clock next morning, if called for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We pass over his mother’s expostulations, and
Vi’let’s evil prognostics, who said she had seen
Nanny Boynton that very day, “sowing seed in the
ground backward, and talking to herself all the
while, when she went over to scold Dinah for not
bringing home the brass kettle she had borrowed.”
George was deaf to all. He was up and dressed
next morning by one o’clock; the wind, however,
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
had no mind to be hurried, and did not choose to set
fair till day-break, when Dick appeared with his
summons, and off the two lads set in high spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother would probably have passed a very
melancholy day, it being the first time her son had
been out of her sight, with the prospect of being absent
longer than a few hours; but her husband taking
occasion to intimate that his counting-room wanted
a thorough cleaning, and his book-shelves putting in
order—a task she always superintended herself,
aided by her niece—he hinting, moreover, that he
should be glad of their assistance in making out a
catalogue of the books, which had long been needed,
ample employment was afforded to all three, to keep
George from their thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now about the middle of June. The summer
had so far been dry and dusty, and every thing
appeared languishing for want of rain. At length
Dame Nature, like a notable housewife, began to
feel her temper rise at the dirt and disorder of every
thing belonging to her. She rated her house-maids
soundly—“Idle hussies! that did nothing but loiter
and sleep night and day; they had not done a stroke
of work to tell since the March cleaning; they did
not even earn the breath they drew! There were
her beautiful grassy carpets, not three months old,
an inch thick with dust; their flowers were all faded
and their turf dried up and withered. Her windows!
not a star could shine through them; and as for the
curtains, they were of such a color, it would puzzle
a philosopher to tell what they were made of. Her
crystal and once clear fountains were unfilled, and
the bright surface of their mirrors covered with green
slime. She was actually ashamed the sun should
look upon such a scene of neglect! The slothful,
lazy jades had better bestir themselves, for not one
of them should get into their beds till every hole and
corner was cleaned, and put into thorough order; or
she would know the reason why!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elements roused from their lethargy, and
chafed by their imperious mistress, sighed and muttered—the
clouds huddled together scowling, and
sending forth a low murmur of discontent, dropped
a few angry tears. The winds brandished their
besoms, and with one sweep made dust, leaves and
branches, and even small trees, scuttle-doors and
hen-coops all fly before them. It was an unlucky
day for ancient buildings! The roof of one respectable
old barn, whose shingles had for some time
been moving up and down like feathers on a fowl’s
back, was at length seen sailing with great dignity
across the street, to the manifold terror of two old
women who kept a huckster’s shop there; but whose
premises, however, escaped uninjured, it alighting
very considerately on the field behind their house.
The winds having performed these feats, rested
awhile to take breath. The lightnings now flashed
and the thunders roared; the clouds dashed from
their brimming pails the torrents, which rolling
over hills and valleys and through streets and lanes,
formed rivers in the gutters, and carried all before
them, which the winds had scattered in their way,
into the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the afternoon of this day, two hours before
sunset but after tea, Madam Fayerweather and her
niece took their accustomed seat at a pleasant window
in a small apartment which served as a kind of
ante-room to madam’s own chamber. On one side
a door opened at right angles with the head of the
front stairs, and from which a long passage led
through this story. Facing this door was the one
which opened at the head of the back stairs; while
a third, opposite the window, led into madam’s
chamber. Vi’let was seated at the kitchen-door,
directly beneath the window, solacing herself with
her pipe; while Tabby winked and purred at her
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy Boynton’s kitchen and wood-shed, at the
distance of some rods, were nearly hidden from
sight by a hedge of tall lilacs and rose-bushes bounding
Mr. Fayerweather’s premises on this side, the
view took in gardens, orchards and fields extending
to the North river, (a small inlet from the sea so
called,) the whole space of which is now covered
with streets and houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy was reading to her aunt, who, with a large
basket of fragments of silk of various colors at her
side, was deeply engaged in an elaborate piece of
work, concerning which she affected a great mystery,
keeping its purpose and destination a profound
secret. Both aunt and niece were so much engrossed
by the subject of the book—it was Clarissa Harlow,
which had lately been received from England—that
the darkening sky and rising wind had escaped their
notice. A loud scream from Vi’let aroused their
attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O! the massiful s’us! there’s the old witch flying
away at last! Land’s sake alive! O-h-h-h!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both looked out, and behold! there was
Nanny Boynton in good earnest—at least so their
terrors made them believe—high in air, her red
cloak fluttering, amidst a cloud of dust, shingles,
staves of old tubs, broomsticks, etc. etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She directed her course south, and was soon lost
to view, while the dismay of madam and Amy deprived
them of the power of utterance. At length,
on Amy’s turning her eyes to the spot whence she
supposed the whirlwind had caught up their ill-fated
neighbor, what met her sight but the object of their
terrors herself, on firm ground, but despoiled of cloak,
’kerchief and cap; her lean and bony arms bare and
extended, and each separate hair of her gray locks
on end; giving her much the appearance of one of
the weird sisters in the midst of an incantation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aunt and niece were expressing their relief
at Nanny’s escape from being carried off bodily,
when the recollection of her son, exposed on the
water to the fury of a hurricane, now darted into
the mind of the former. She shrieked out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, George! my child, my child! what will become
of you! Oh, Mr. Fayerweather, why did you
let him go!” she exclaimed to her husband, who at
this moment entered the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was ashy pale, but no other indication of the
dreadful apprehension under which he was suffering
was visible on his countenance, and not being able
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
to nerve himself to bear the sight of his wife’s
agonies, should she know how strong were the
grounds for her fears, he endeavored to make light
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, do not be in trouble about George;
he’s far beyond the reach of this little squall; he and
Dick have probably been in New York these two
hours.” (Mr. Fayerweather hoped devoutly to be
forgiven for thus belying his conscience, well-knowing
that implicit confidence would be placed in his
assurances.) “He and Dick, I have no doubt, are
now patroling the streets with eyes and mouths
wide open at the wonders they see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I am rejoiced if they are out of the reach
of this hurricane; but I hope Captain Seaward will
not trust them alone in New York streets; I have
always heard it is a terrible place for children.
Sometimes they are kidnapped as I have heard tell,”
replied Mrs. Fayerweather, her fears somewhat
quieted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you need not be afraid of that, my dear; the
captain promised faithfully that he would not suffer
George to go out of his sight,” said her husband as
he left the apartment, and Amy resumed her book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gust, after several vain attempts to shake the
solid old mansion from its foundation, at length relaxed
its efforts and fell into a calm; the sky cleared
up and the sun went down in tranquil beauty. Before
its disc had wholly disappeared, however, it
was surrounded by a light haze, which gradually
spreading and deepening, at length assumed the form
of a dark thunder-cloud, reaching nearly to the
zenith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flash of lightning was the signal for the whole
household to assemble, and before the low, deep
bass of the distant thunder reached their ears, they
were all collected within madam’s chamber and its
nearest precincts. The bed was her own retreat,
and she would have been glad to have given the
whole family a place on it could they have found
room. Amy, whose fears were scarcely less, seated
herself on a low stool by the bed-side, and leaning
her arms on the bed buried her face in the counterpane.
Vi’let without ceremony ensconced herself
in the easy-chair, rocking to and fro and groaning out
at intervals, “Oh, that old witch!” while old Tabby,
who did not choose to be left alone in the kitchen,
crowded in by her side, and took her full share of
the cushion. Not finding another low seat, Flora
took the floor at the side of Miss Amy, and leaned
her arms on a chair in imitation of her young mistress;
and Peter placed himself at first on the top-most
of the back stairs, but by degrees, as the storm
increased, edged further into the apartment, and at
length after a loud clap of thunder, planted himself
on one leg against the side of the door, with his
woolly poll half in his mistress’s chamber. John,
who enjoyed a thunder-storm above all things, took
his station at a window where he could best see the
lightning, while his father and Mr. Wendell, a young
lawyer who was an admirer of Amy, and was now
added to the family party, paced up and down the
long passage, extending their walk into the antechamber
before-mentioned, in a corner of which
Scipio had placed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the long summer twilight had but just
commenced, darkness had suddenly covered the face
of all things, when a dash of lightning, more intense
than the sun, quivered for a moment through the
passage and in the chambers, accompanied by a crash
of thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The massiful s’us!” groaned Vi’let. “The lawful
massy!” ejaculated Flora. Poor madam could
only whisper, “O dear! dear!” Amy trembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s royal!” cried John, starting up and
clapping his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be silent, boy,” said his father, sternly—“is this
a time—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Fayerweather, my dear, are you sure
George is safe?” madam implored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, my dear,” replied her husband, “he’s
safe as we all are—in the hands of Divine Providence.
Peter, get candles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chattering of teeth was heard, but the statue
did not stir from its pedestal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scipio, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, master, it’s Aunt Vi’let’s business
to get ’em ready,” said Scip in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worthy gentleman, not feeling himself equal
to an encounter with Vi’let in such an extremity,
said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it will be the shortest way to get them
myself,” and made preparations to do so; at which
Vi’let, safe in the easy-chair, displayed great indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you go, Scip? there’s master going
himself, if I’m alive. I wish I was near you, I’d
see if you didn’t stir your stumps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A low grumble was heard from Scip in the ante-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold your tongue, you black nigger,” returned
Vi’let from the easy-chair; “aint ye ’shamed yeself?
’sturbing madam and all the good family with
your clamor. If I was master I would soon clear
the house of you all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this colloquy, or rather monologue, John,
starting up, made but two steps over the stairs and
soon reappeared with lights. Mr. Fayerweather
then took up the prayer-book which, with the large
bible, lay on the table in the inner chamber, and
asked his young friend if he would read prayers, his
own broken voice sufficiently showing himself unequal
to the office. Mr. Wendell, with a little hesitation
took the book, turned over a few leaves,
while the household all assembled kneeling in the
chamber; when, amidst the roar of the storm without,
his voice was soon heard, in tones solemn and
low, like some spirit of peace rebuking the angry
elements. He read with deep feeling a part of the
evening service, with prayers for the midst of a
storm. This act of submission and trust in Him
who rules the tempest and makes the whirlwinds to
obey, calmed the spirits and elevated the thoughts
of the little assembly. Madam soon fell into a gentle
slumber, and Vi’let’s nasal organs gave tokens that
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
she had followed her mistress’s example. Flora
and Peter ditto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm at length somewhat abated, but Mr.
Fayerweather resumed his walk. After a while he
stopped suddenly for a moment, and then exclaiming,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Almighty be praised! there’s George’s
voice,” and ran down stairs, followed by John, Mr.
Wendell and Amy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loud and rough voices, but in high good-humor,
with shouts of laughter, were now heard rapidly
approaching the house. They all opened the front-door
together, and in crowded Captain Seaward,
Captain Bob Stimpson and the two lads. Captain
Seaward said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Mr. Fayerweather, I’ve brought George
home t’ye, safe and sound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Bob Stimpson, in order to draw the attention
of the company to himself, cleared his throat
with a humph, in which were harmoniously blended
the German guttural and the French nasal, and
striking his huge cane on the floor, added—“And if
there’s another two such lads in the whole province
of Massachusetts Bay, I am not Captain Robert
Stimpson!—why, they saved the vessel and the lives
of us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Captain Seaward chimed in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ye see, Mr. Fayerweather, the gale was sich
a one as not many of us had often been out in afore;
and at one time when it blew so strong as to
threaten to capsize the vessel, one of the ropes got
loose, and it was needful for somebody to go aloft
and make it fast without loss of time, or the vessel
would have gone to pot in less than no time. Not a
lubber of a sailor would stir, but they all stood staring
at each other like so many sculpens. Brayton’s
stout-hearted enough, but he’s lame, and Stimpson
here and I are both old and clumsy”—Captain Bob
Stimpson fetched a grunt—“but we were going to
try what our old carcases could do, when them ’ere
two lads pushed afore us, and were up the shrouds
in a twinkling and fastened the rope. The vessel
was saved, but she was so much strained that we
were obliged to put back for repairs, and for Brayton
to get some better hands. So, now we’ll shake
hands and bid ye good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather tried hard to prevail on the
two sea-worthies to stay and eat supper; but Captain
Seaward excused himself, alleging that his “old
woman would be skeared about them;” his friend,
Stimpson, adding—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my daughter, Judy, will cry herself to
pieces, if she doesn’t see her sir to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noise below now aroused Madam Fayerweather,
who called out between sleeping and
waking:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Amy?—Mr. Fayerweather?”
Then thoroughly awake, she exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they all gone?” and rising from the
bed, said in a louder tone—“Vi’let, what upon earth
is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vi’let snored out, “It’s that ’ere Scip; he’s the
torment and plague of my life—he’s always making
a hullagaloo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the whole party entered the chamber. What
was madam’s surprise at seeing George! When
she discovered that he had been out in all the
storm, she complained loudly of having been kept
in ignorance of his danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As if I was not his mother, and had not a right
to know every thing about him; but it’s the way you
always do, Mr. Fayerweather, and I do not take it
kindly of you at all. I should have had a fit had I
known that he was on the water all this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And madam was near falling into one at the idea
of it; but the fear that her son might be half-starved,
and not be able to get any thing to eat if she should
take up the time in having hysterics, made her think
better of it; so she desired Vi’let to get a good supper
and make George some white wine-whey.
Vi’let, punching Peter down stairs before her, and
followed by her satellite Flora, made her descent,
grumbling and muttering at having <span class='it'>vittles</span> to get at
that time o’ night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had an excellent supper, during which
George related all the wonders which he and Dick had
seen and performed on that memorable day—and if
he felt somewhat lifted up, might he not be pardoned?
After supper Mr. Wendell took his leave,
and the family sought repose; though not before offering
up fervent thanks for George’s preservation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shrill reveille of the barn-yard trumpeter
early aroused Nature from her slumbers, and fearing
she had overslept herself from the fatigues of yesterday,
she threw off her dark counterpane and donned
in haste her gray kirtle. The bull-frog had ceased
tuning his eternal bass-viol, and with the beetle, the
whippowil, the owl, and other roysterers of the
night, had gone to bed. All was still, excepting that
here and there might be heard the soft twitter of
some warbler who was to take part in the grand
chorus of the morning, as nestled among the branches
he tuned his little pipe. Her wearied handmaidens
were yet sleeping after their night’s toil; and their
indulgent mistress left them awhile longer to their
repose, for never had they better performed her bidding.
The eastern casements were new hung in
draperies of rose-color and gold, and the morning-star
was peeping in, to see that all was in order for
his monarch’s arrival; while the moon still lingered
near the western portal, to take one look at his joyous
visage before her departure. The west-wind
now woke, and sweeping fragrance from the new-born
flowers, gently fanned the face of the careful
matron as she cast a pleased eye over her fair domain.
Her fountains were filled to the brim and
gleamed in the early light; her fresh green turf was
glittering with gems, and a diamond hung from every
leaf of her foliage. But the paling of the morning-star
now gave notice of the sun’s approach; and
spying his steeds advancing over the ocean, and her
broad mirrors reflecting his glance on their burnished
surfaces, she gave the signal for the morning concert
to strike up, and all radiant with smiles welcomed
her lordly visitor. The moon meekly courtesied
her adieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vi’let was early astir this morning. She went
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
down stairs, her cap on one ear, very much out of
humor at having the house to put to rights again,
“arter working like a dog all yesterday from sunrise
till midnight.” Routing up Scip and Peter, and
setting Flora to put the breakfast-room in order, she
then placed the coffee and chocolate on the fire, and
the cakes into the Dutch-oven to bake—this, the
reader will recollect, was before the era of cooking-stoves
and ranges—after which she called out to
Flora to know if Dinah had brought back the frying-pan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Aunt Vi’let,” returned Flora, in a deprecating
tone; “but you mustn’t blame me, for I told
her you’d want it this morning to fry the flap-jacks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s always the way with that old witch,
Nanny; if she gets any thing out of anybody, they’ve
good luck to get it again—Pete’, what are you gaping
at me for? Why don’t you clean master’s shoes,
you lazy nigger? What’s Scip’ poking about—why
don’t he bring in the stuff to make the fire burn?
Breakfast wont be ready till nine o’clock, and madam
will be down scolding so that the house wont hold
her—sich a life as I lead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here she went across the yard to the hedge dividing
her master’s premises from those of Jemmy
Boynton, thrust her head through the lilacs yet in
full bloom—the white linen border of her cap turned
back, setting off to great advantage her ebony complexion—and
called out,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinah!”—then louder and sharper, “Dinah!”—no
Dinah appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the old gallows ails the gal, that I must
split my throat a screeching arter her!” then raising
her voice to the utmost pitch—“Di-i-ina-ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Dinah’s head appeared out of a little square
window in the out-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wanting, Aunt Vi’let?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wanting?—the frying-pan’s wanting—what
d’ye think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laud ’a’massy, Aunt Vi’let, I forgot all about it;
we had sich a rumpus here yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rumpus! yes, I ’spect you <span class='it'>had</span> a rumpus! I only
wonder the house wa’nt blowed away. Them as
lives with witches must ’spect to ride in the air some
time or ’nother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Aunt Vi’let,” cried Dinah, in a voice
somewhat lower. Here she ran across the yard to
the place of rendezvous, frying-pan in hand, and
added, in a whisper, “I reckon she’s got sharp ears;
I wonders sometimes how our most privatest conversations
gets to her hearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she got her cloak back?” asked Vi’let.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she han’t got it yet; but I ’spect she’ll get
it to-day; the wind blowed it over to South fields,
and it got stuck in the top of a tree. They had sich
a time about it last night, I thought they’d raise the
neighbors, case Tom Duckenfield wouldn’t go and
look arter it, arter he’d rung the bell for nine. She
’clared she’d put him in jail for the one-and-sixpence
he owed her for milk; and Tom said she’d better
take care, or he’d let out about the bran, he see her
steal, that old Swasey begged for his pig, to feed
her cow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bran from old Swasey’s pig!” exclaimed
Vi’let in indignation; “I guess she needn’t steal
much bran! the cow gets all her living out of our
barn. She gets in when the gate is shut fast! the
old witch knows how. Pete’ says he see her lift up
the latch with her horns; now, what nat’ral cow,
that’s <span class='it'>raly</span> a cow, would have sense to do that, I
want to know! Oh, I see’d well enough what she
raly was, one night last winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what was it?” asked Dinah, with ears and
eyes wide open for the marvelous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why it was just afore nine o’clock, and I heard
old Tabby miaow terribly at the kitchen-door. I
opened it, and in she flew, looking as if she was
skeared to pieces! her tail was as big as that,”
(doubling up her fist.) “So I looks out to see what
it was as frightened her so, when, a standing inside
the barn-door, I see’d—as true as you stand there—I
see’d a woman, all in white, without n’ary head!
it had a handkercher in its hand, and it kept a waving
it back’ards and for’ards—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should ha’ swounded away dead,” said Dinah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So would anybody but me; but I kept up my
courage, for my temper ris; I thought Nanny was
at the bottom of it all along, though I know’d it was
a sperit—for I’ve see’d enough on ’em,” she continued,
her imagination kindling with the subject;
“and it rolled its eyes, and—and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Aunt Vi’let,” observed Dinah, submissively,
“I thought you said it hadn’t n’ary head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold your tongue, you fool! what do you keep
’terrupting me for? Where was I? Well, then,
it fetched a sithe—sich a sithe!—I couldn’t stand it
no longer; so I called master out. ‘There, sir,’
says I, ‘now I hope you’ll believe your own eyes’—for
he always laughs and ri-dicules at witches and
ghosts, and all them sort o’ things. So I tell’d him—and
out he goes. I see all the time he was skeared
enough, only he was ’shamed to show it afore me;
but when he got to the barn-door, he set up sich a
laugh—you might a hearn him into your house. I
’clare it made my hair stand on eend to hear him.
‘Here,’ says he, ‘Vi’let, your woman without a head
is changed into a cow’s hind legs and tail!’ and sure
enough, it was the beast then, but I know’d well
enough what it was afore. Howsomenever, it wan’t
no use a telling him; so I takes a skillet of biling
water, that was on the fire, to bile some eggs—for
our folks must always have some mess o’nother hot
for supper, to keep me at it slaving from morning to
night; not but I likes a little bit o’ suthen comfortable
myself afore I goes to bed, and the most part on
it comes into the kitchen. So I was going to fling it on
to her, to see what she’d turn into next; but master
tell’d me to let her alone, for the barn wouldn’t miss
a little hay. Did you ever hear any thing so ’diclous!
I tell’d him—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt Vi’let! Aunt Vi’let!” was now heard from
the kitchen-door; “the cakes is burning, and mistress
wants to know if breakfast wont be ready
soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why don’t Flora take the cakes out of the
oven, then! Can’t nothing be done without me?”
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
cried Vi’let. “For the laud’s sake, give me my
frying-pan, and let me go, or I shall have the whole
house arter me.” She went into the kitchen in a
hurry, took up her cakes, and fried her flap-jacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After their morning devotions, the Fayerweather
family, in high spirits, gathered round the breakfast-table.
This was laid in the western room, before
an open glass-door, which looked into the garden.
The cool morning breeze, after frolicking among
the flowers, found its way in at the door, and mingling
its stolen perfumes with those of the coffee and
chocolate, played antics with the table-cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might here describe the breakfast; but as there
was nothing appertaining to it which greatly differed
from a modern one, I will just ask the reader to imagine
his or her own family circle—which is, doubtless,
the most agreeable in the world—in the best
possible humor, and with excellent appetites, before
a repast exactly suited to the taste of each individual
of said family, seasoned by all the wit and liveliness
possessed by each, in a peculiar degree, and my task
will be accomplished in the best possible manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this memorable period, all George’s accustomed
avocations became tedious and disagreeable
to him. Greek and Latin, in both of which he had
made an unwilling progress, under Master Goodwin,
of the grammar school, to prepare him for college, he
now actually loathed; and his father found he must
give up the hope nearest his heart, of ever seeing his
eldest son distinguished in one of the learned professions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my boy,” he said at last, “if, as you say,
you are convinced you can never make a scholar, as
it is not my way to drive a nail that will not go, I
consent to your giving up Greek and Latin; though
I <span class='it'>did</span> hope to see you in one of the professions which
your grandfathers followed so creditably. As to
your going to sea, remember, it is wholly against my
inclination. I shall expect you to continue at school
two years; then, if you make such progress in general
learning, and in studies connected with navigation,
as to give me reason to hope seeing you something
above the mate of a Marblehead skipper, I will then
consent, though I should much prefer your going
into a counting-house in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youth, satisfied with the hope of obtaining his
father’s consent to his following the sea on any
terms, promised faithfully to do all that was required
of him; and, moreover, possessing some common
sense, a quality not usually abounding in characters
of his stamp, he set his mind to applying itself with
energy and perseverance to the studies dictated by
his father and Master Goodwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the two years specified, two events of note
occurred in the Fayerweather family; one was
Amy’s marriage. This was conducted with all the
state due to so important an occasion. The time for
Amy’s “<span class='it'>walking bride</span>,” as it was termed, for the
three Sundays succeeding the wedding, happened to
be unfortunately in the early spring, the first Sunday
falling on Easter, near the beginning of April. The
bridal procession, consisting of the happy pair walking
arm-in-arm, four bridemaids and as many groomsmen,
set off from Mr. Fayerweather’s and paraded
the whole length of Essex street to the end of St.
Peter’s, where stood the church of wood dedicated
to the same saint, lately replaced by a handsome
gothic edifice of stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bride was attired in a rich white satin; her
fair neck shaded by a tucker of costly Brussels’ lace,
a ruffle of the same falling over her dimpled elbow.
Her sharp-pointed shoes, with heels three inches
high, were of white brocade, with a silver flower in
the toe, and brilliant paste buckles, nearly covering
the instep. Any thing in the shape of hat, bonnet,
cloak or scarf would have been altogether <span class='it'>outré</span> on
such an occasion. The large fan which it was customary
for the bride to carry, and to hold up gracefully
to shade her face, was mounted with white
leather on which was painted, in lively colors, the
wedding train of Isaac and Rebecca; Rebecca in a
sacque, with triple ruffled cuffs, and Isaac in a full-bottomed
periwig; walking side by side, through
arches festooned with flowers, followed by six pairs
of young nymphs holding the Jewish bride’s train;
whilst a winged Cupid, with bow and arrows, and a
Hymen, with his torch pointing to the church in the
distance, marshaled the procession. A pair of turtle-doves,
imagined to be cooing, sat on the arch directly
over the heads of the happy couple. This fan was
the wonder and admiration of the <span class='it'>élite</span> of Salem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wendell was in a coat of milk-white broad-cloth,
with nether garments of white satin, and paste
knee-buckles; and a white satin waistcoat flowered
with silver, in the button-hole of which was placed
a large bouquet of hyacinths, which Amy had coaxed
to bloom for the occasion. A chapeau-bras held
under his arm completed his equipments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a raw and disagreeable day in this least
pleasant of the seasons in New England; with an
east wind—which sourest and most ill-tempered of
the children of Eolus usually blows on the seacoast
from the beginning of April until the end of May,
and oftentimes encroaching far into June. By a
miracle the bride did not catch a cold. On the
second Sunday she wore her second suit, a rose-colored
damask, and on the third a straw-colored
paduasoy; each week “sitting up for company”
every day, with her attendants, in the afternoon for
ladies, and in the evening for gentlemen, drest in the
habiliments she wore on the Sunday beginning the
week. These indispensable ceremonies were usually
performed under the roof of the bride’s parent
or guardian; after which the new-married pair took
possession of their own house. That of Mr. and
Mrs. Wendell, as will be seen presently, was
situated at a very short distance from Mr. Fayerweather’s,
where Amy still spent the greater part
of her time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other event of importance that took place
during George’s two years of probation was the obtaining
of a quit-claim by Mr. Fayerweather from
Jemmy and Nanny Boynton. This he had obtained
through the assistance of his new nephew, Mr.
Wendell, and without paying more than one third
more than it was worth. After securing this deed
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
or quit-claim the kind uncle converted Boynton’s
house and his old ware-house, which stood near it,
into a pretty residence for the young married couple,
in order, as he said, to have Cousin Amy still under
his own wing. As soon as the important negotiation
with the Boyntons was concluded, Mr. Fayerweather
came with all possible haste to make the
joyful communication to the family. As he laid the
document in triumph on the table he said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, my dear, I have got the quit-claim at
last from the Boyntons. The land is all our own
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On hearing these words, madam aroused herself
from a deep reverie and exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La! Mr. Fayerweather, you don’t say so; how
thankful I am. How did you prevail on them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Wendell and I were too strong for them;
though Nanny, I believe, would still have held on
if I had not offered a good deal more than I had intended;
and she was not satisfied after all; but I
don’t care, I have the deed, and now we shall be
rid of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two lads, who were laying their heads together
at the window, and planning, it is to be feared,
some mischief, started up in a transport—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ll have a bonfire out in the field to-night,
as high as the house, in spite of them,” cried
John, “to-night’s Gunpowder Treason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” added George, “and we’ll burn Jemmy
for Pope; I know a capital way to get his old wig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do no such thing, boys,” interrupted their
father; “you may make your bonfire up to the moon
if you will, but let Jemmy Boynton alone—we are
quit of him now, and you shall give no occasion for
any more brawls with him or Nanny either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With Nanny! no indeed!” and madam, clasping
her hands, cast her eyes upward, rolling them in
a very remarkable manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youths went out, and their father was following
them, when a “Mr. Fayerweather, my dear,”
stopped him short, and he turned round to his better
half, who, he saw, was dying to make some very
momentous communication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear, what is it? What have you to
tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, I meant to have told you before,
but you were so full of business this morning that I
had not a chance; but I think you ought to know.”
Madam looked awful and mysterious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what was it? Did Nanny’s red cloak
take another flight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La! no, my dear—you’ll never forget that, I
believe—but this is what took place in our own
kitchen, and I saw it with my own eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what was it then? I am all impatience
to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam cleared her voice—“Why, I happened to
be in the kitchen yesterday, just before tea-time,
when Dinah came over to borrow half a pint of meal
to make some porridge for Nanny, so I asked Dinah
what was the matter with her? for you know that
nobody takes porridge but when they are sick, and
not then, if they can afford a little posset, or even
oatmeal gruel with raisins in it. Dinah said, she
was sure she did not know what ailed her, but she
was so nervous and cross there was no living in the
house with her. I reproved Dinah for talking so of
her mistress, and after she was gone I told Vi’let to
make some nice sack-posset, and carry it over to
Nanny; you know, with all their money, they
scarcely afford themselves the necessaries of life.
Vi’let grumbled enough, and said ‘water porridge
was good enough for witches, and too good, too;’
however, she went to get the skillet to boil the milk
in, and when she came back with it in her hand,
what should slip in between her feet but a monstrous
great black cat. Old Tabby always fights all strange
cats, but when she saw this, she slunk away, and
hid herself behind the settle. Vi’let was going to
strike the strange cat over with the skillet, but I
would not let her—not bethinking myself that it was
any thing more than a common cat—though it was
the biggest one I ever saw—but it seemed to be nothing
more than skin and bone, and it rubbed up
against me and mewed so pitifully, that I told Vi’let
not to hurt the creature, but to give it something to
eat. Vi’let said she wasn’t going to do no such
thing; and if I wanted to give Christian folks’ vittles
to evil sperits I might get it myself. Then she tried
to strike it again; when the creature, or whatever it
was, hunched up its back and spit at her; and then
it set up an awful yowl and disappeared. I thought
I saw it go out after Dinah; but Vi’let said it banished
up chimney; and she was sure Nanny sent it to bewitch
us all. And this morning she says she was
pinched black-and-blue all night, so that she couldn’t
sleep a wink, and took three crooked pins out of her
sleeve, which she was sure she never put there, for
she has only two, and one of them hasn’t any head.
She showed me her arm that was pinched so; it was
certainly very much swollen, though I couldn’t see
any black-and-blue marks for the color of her skin.
I am pretty sure <span class='it'>I</span> felt some twitches, too, in my
right arm; and this morning I had the strangest
cramp in my foot. I wet my finger and crossed the
place, and the cramp went off; but I feel all the time
as if it was coming on again. Now what do you
think of all this, Mr. Fayerweather? Don’t you
think it high time Nanny was seen to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. F. looked comical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what are you laughing at?” said madam,
in an unwonted pet; “I’ll never tell you any thing
again, if Nanny bewitches us all together, which
it’s likely enough she’ll do, now we have the land
against her will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be offended, my love,” said her husband;
“I was only pleased to have my mind made easy on
one score—you’ll never be hanged for a witch, I
am sure; and as to Nanny, why, I think you may
safely leave her to Vi’let—I’ll match her with any
witch in the Bay Province.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam was appeased, though not wholly satisfied,
but, as in duty bound, said no more, not being quite
sure as to the twitches; and having, moreover, a
vague suspicion that Vi’let’s swollen arm might be
occasioned by the rheumatism, though she would
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
have scarcely ventured such a surmise to Vi’let herself.
The matter of the strange cat she dismissed
from her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George’s two years of probation passed rather
slowly to him; but at last they came to a close. He
had improved his time to the entire satisfaction of his
father, having made such progress in his studies as
to reflect great credit on Master Goodwin, and also
prove his own industrious application. His predilection
for a sea-faring life had rather strengthened
than abated, and his father could no longer withhold
his consent. A favorable opportunity was all George
waited for, which soon presented itself. Captain
Brayton was going on a voyage up the Mediterranean,
and was to proceed to London, and touch at
several European ports in coming home. He had a
good crew, and Captain Seaward made interest with
his old friend to take his son and George as light
hands, and to keep them under his especial protection,
lamenting at the same time that the Two
Pollys, which was lying in the dock, undergoing
some repairs, could not be made ready for the
voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Captain Brayton sails, we beg leave to introduce
to the reader another one of young Fayerweather’s
acquaintance Down-in-town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, also, bore the title of captain, which was accorded
to all who, like himself, had ever been a
ship-master—old Captain Bob Stimpson—a short,
thick-set man, with legs like a mill-post, the upper
parts encased in leather breeches, the lower parts in
blue worsted stockings, with smart shoes fastened
with huge silver buckles of great brilliancy. His
wig, which had once been black, was rendered nearly
red by age, and formed a setting to his redder face,
which matched well with his huge bottle-nose of the
same fiery hue. But do not mistake, gentle reader;
Captain Bob Stimpson was a temperate man. He
usually wore a brown coat and waistcoat, out of
which latter appeared ostentatiously the ruffle of his
shirt, broader than usual for the fashion of the day.
He was a man of substance, and owner of a rope-walk,
at the door of which he was usually found
seated, pipe in mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could a youth of seventeen find in the society
of such an old codger of fifty-two? Can you guess,
my fair reader? He had a daughter—the Down-in-town
beauty, she was called; a girl of whom any
father might have been proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was his only child; her beauty was a rare
specimen of the blonde, with a high polished forehead,
and exquisite features. A slight drooping of
the lid at the outer corner of her clear blue eyes,
sometimes gave a shade of sadness to her lovely
countenance; but when animated, these eyes became
bright and merry, and her face was radiant with
dimpled smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Stimpson’s house was considered a fine
one for the time in which he lived. It was a large
square building, situated in the midst of a spacious
terrace, of which the under part was improved for
shops, for the sale of ready-made seaman’s clothing;
and the lawn in front of his house was directly over
their roofs. The ascent to the terrace was by a long
flight of stone-steps, situated between two shops.
The lawn was covered with fine grass, bordered with
rose-bushes and lilac-trees, and a broad gravel-walk
through the centre led to the house. This was of
three stories, with a cupola on the top, which cupola
the two captains used for a look-out, when vessels
were coming in or going out; it commanded a view
of the harbor; the house being situated in that part
of the town now called Neptune street, or as they
used to say, “down on the wharves.” There was
nothing further remarkable about the house, excepting
the cap of the front-door, which was ornamented
by a figure of Neptune, with his trident—the wonder
and admiration of all the young mermen of the
vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George first saw Judith Stimpson—conceive of a
beauty with such a name!—as he went with Dick,
one summer afternoon, on some errand from the
father of the latter to Captain Stimpson. She was
with a little troop of companions who were on an
afternoon’s visit to her, having finished all the tasks
of sewing and knitting which their prudent mothers
had set them. As yet pianos were scarcely invented,
and there was but one spinnet in the place, and
this was viewed by some with distrust, as having a
secret connection with witchcraft. Judith and her
companions issued from the house for a game of
romps on the terrace. It was not in those days considered
as infringing on decorum for girls of thirteen
to play at “blindman’s-buff,” “old Tickleder,” or
“hide-and-seek” in the open air. The little girls
had just formed the magic circle around the beautiful
Judith, who, dressed in a yellow grogram, with
elbow-sleeves and ruffles of worked cat-gut over her
round, white arms, was dancing with great glee,
and singing in a voice rather loud for a young lady
of her years, “Ring around the maiden in Uncle
Johnny’s garden,” her light, silken curls flying in
every direction round her glowing and innocent
face, when who should appear on the terrace but the
two young men! Away scampered the girls, vainly
endeavoring to reach the house before their tormentors
could catch them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judith was caught by Dick, who pretended to insist
strongly on taking the forfeit she had incurred,
while she blushed and struggled to free herself from
his grasp. George, seeing the pain and confusion
she evidently felt at being thus surprised, insisted on
Dick’s releasing her without the forfeited kiss; and
it was then he first observed her great beauty and
modesty. While his friend went into the house to
do his errand, he so improved his acquaintance with
the little girls that he soon became foremost in their
plays. At “hide-and-seek” and “old Tickleder,”
he was found incomparable. They were just forming
a circle in “Ring around the maiden,” round
Betty Brayton, a little black-eyed girl, the intimate
friend of Judith, the hand of the latter of whom
George had taken care to secure, when Dick came
out. He, after teazing the girls and rallying his
friend a little, drew him, rather reluctantly, away;
not, however, before George had gathered a rose,
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
and flinging it at Judith, said slyly, in a rather low
tone, “Keep that for my sake.” From this time he
seized every opportunity of improving his acquaintance
with Judith; and several keepsakes passed
between them. Those from Judith being extorted
rather than given, and those from George received
with a merry laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>About</span> twenty years ago, there lived near the
pretty town of Launceston, in Cornwall, an elderly
maiden lady named La Vellette. She was of French
origin, and had emigrated to England about the commencement
of the first French Revolution. She was
remarkable for the simplicity of her manner, and the
amiability of her character. Exhibiting but little of
that vivacity which usually characterizes her fair
countrywomen, she nevertheless displayed a subdued
cheerfulness, which, while it did not stimulate
mirth, never tended to arrest a merry laugh or an
innocent joke. In person she was small, and her
features, though marked by age, and saddened by
care, still bore the lingering traces of beauty. Her
neat, retired, and snug little cottage, which, in summer,
used to peep forth beneath a forest of honeysuckle
and ivy, and her prim and Quaker-like simplicity
of dress, were in happy harmony with her
disposition. Living in my youthful days within a
few yards of her residence, I was frequently invited
with my playmates to visit her garden. Gradually
I became an especial favorite; and I used to feel so
much at home in her company, that I needed no invitation
to pay her frequent visits. She seemed to
take a high degree of interest in my amusements,
and that of my companions; and when any conflicts
arose from the mysteries of a game at marbles, or
from the strategy in hide-and-seek, she would be the
first to heal up the difficulty, and restore amicability.
Another valuable trait, which, boy as I was, I could
not help observing, was the unwavering resignation
which she always exhibited; while on the other hand,
I was remarkable for my impatience, and a somewhat
irritable disposition. And when, as often I did, I laid
my complaints before her, when I grieved about the
loss of a favorite top, or the death of a favorite pigeon,
I was always met with her sympathy, and gently chid
for my discontentment. Soothing me with her mild
but sorrowful smile, she would draw me to her
bosom, and strive to show me the folly of grieving
for an unavoidable loss, and the duty of submitting
manfully to misfortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her neighbors her early history was involved
in some degree of obscurity. They knew she was a
French <span class='it'>emigré</span>, that many years ago a favorite sister
had died, and that she had been deprived of her
parents at an early age. They had heard it rumored
that she had suffered from severe misfortunes—that
her connections had been people of rank, and while
they all knew she enjoyed a competence, some conjectured
she was even wealthy. Other stories of a
romantic character were sometimes circulated, but
unsupported by any degree of certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My esteem for her grew with my growth, and I
have reason to believe that it was reciprocated; but
as I advanced in years, my visits became less frequent,
from unavoidable circumstances. At length
the period arrived when I was called upon to leave
home for a situation in a foreign land, and as I had
often felt a strong desire to become acquainted with
her history, I called upon her on the day previous to
my departure to take my farewell, and to see if I
could have my curiosity gratified. After I had expressed
this wish with all the delicacy my confusion
enabled me, and had excused the request by intimating
the possibility that we might never meet
again, she consented to leave me a brief account
after her death. And that event, she added, is not
far hence. Something tells me that my pulse will
soon cease to beat, and my heart to throb. I have
long waited for Heaven’s messenger; I have long
panted for that land “where the wicked cease from
troubling, and where the weary are at rest.” She
then gave me a few words of advice, she pressed her
lips upon my cheek, placed a small parcel, containing
a gold watch and ring, into my hand, and then, in a
broken voice, bade me farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her anticipation of death was speedily realized.
I was told that, about eleven months after my departure,
while reading her Bible in an arm-chair,
she suddenly and silently vanished, like one of
heaven’s stars, into the other world. Among her
papers was a packet directed to me, in which was
the following brief sketch of her early life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was born in the year 1770, at the village of St.
Marc, near Lyons, in France. I was the youngest of
three children, having had a brother and sister. My
parents were connected with families of rank, and,
though well-off, were not wealthy. My mother was
a woman of delicate constitution, and of a most
amiable disposition. She looked upon her husband
as the beau-ideal of perfection, and with a mother’s
partiality, she thought her children were paragons
of beauty. My father was certainly a kind, handsome,
and an intellectual-looking man. In after life
I had opportunities for observing many families, and
I do not remember any father who was fonder of his
home, more devoted to his wife, or more affectionate
to his children. Many years have passed, and many
strange scenes have racked my mind, since I last
saw his dear face; yet the recollection of his features
are still as fresh upon my memory as if I had seen
him to-day. He loved study and his books; and,
though an aristocrat by birth, and a gentleman by
fortune, he was a sincere friend of the people, and an
enemy to the profligacy and oppression of the court.
He was not, that I am aware of, a believer in the
republicanism then advocated. He thought France
was then unfit for a democratic government. He
maintained that all institutions, to be permanent,
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
must be gradual in their growth. The strong and
stately oak, flourishing through centuries, slowly
acquired its vigor and dimension; the animalculæ
springing into life, in a moment of time, becomes as
suddenly extinguished. “What my country needs,”
said he, “is not a universal suffrage, but freer institutions;
not a republic, but opportunities and experience
to fit her for it.” He no less decried the
irreligious doctrines by which liberal opinions were
then so frequently accompanied. “France,” he
would say, in his clear, manly voice, “will never
be really free until she is religious. The reign of
virtue and order must always accompany the reign
of freedom. Without these requisites she may conquer,
but only to be defeated; she may establish a
republic, but it will be only a despotism in disguise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These opinions did not seem to please many of his
auditors, and he would frequently leave a political
club with feelings of grief and despair. He saw no
hope for his country so long as her shackles remained—and
he mistrusted the wisdom of the reforms which
the people desired to introduce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My sister was about two years older than myself.
She was fairer and prettier than I was, and bore a
strong resemblance to my mother. She had light
hair, large, clear blue eyes, and a tall and graceful
figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My brother was five years my senior. He was in
every respect, but in affection, unlike the rest of us.
At an early age, I remember, he exhibited marks of
a powerful frame, with an active, bold, and enthusiastic
disposition. His mind, naturally good, was
improved by an excellent education; and though
carefully watched over by an attentive father, he
could not prevent him from imbibing very extravagant
notions about government, and very loose
opinions upon religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The limits to which I purpose to confine myself,
precludes the possibility of mentioning any of the incidents
connected with my childhood. I shall therefore
pass them by, and in the following pages, merely
allude to those events which may be of interest, and
I hope of profit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suitors made their appearance as my sister and
myself approached womanhood. For some time I
did not discover any one who attracted my attention.
Having every comfort I desired, and parents upon
whom I doated, I was in no hurry to divide my
affection. But we are told that every woman must,
sooner or later, fall in love—and my experience
formed no exception. At a party given by a neighbor,
I was introduced to a young man, who struck
my attention, and who in a short time won my heart.
His name was Alfred Pomiville. He was admitted
on all hands to be very prepossessing; and I thought
he was a model of manly beauty. My parents had
formed the humane and sensible resolution of allowing
their children the disposal of their own affections,
reserving, of course, the right of approving or disapproving
of their choice. When, therefore, my
father became acquainted with my partiality for
Alfred, he did not accuse me of disobedience, but endeavored
to study his disposition and to ascertain his
character. Measuring his feelings by mine own, I
thought the more closely Alfred was studied the
more he would be admired. I was therefore surprised
when I found my father forming a somewhat
undecided opinion of him, and entreating me to be
cautious before I gave away a woman’s dearest
treasure—her heart. I promised obedience to his
advice; but with the characteristic weakness of most
of our sex, when our affections are engaged, I
speedily forgot my promise, and went on confiding
and loving. In the course of a few months I observed
with much pleasure that he gradually rose in
my father’s estimation; with my mother he was from
the first a favorite; and my brother and sister both
considered him agreeable. To me he was kind and
affectionate in the highest degree; he studied my
smallest wish, and seemed devoted to my happiness.
Within a year after our acquaintance he was recognized
by my parents as my future husband, and then
I saw naught but smiles and sunshine before me;
then I thought, in the weakness of my heart, I had
attained the summit of human happiness, and could
defy misfortune.</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'>As time flew on, the dark clouds of the Revolution
advanced. It was now evident to every observing
eye that a fearful storm was at hand. The most
hair-brained courtier, strutting through the balconies
of Versailles, heard the distant rumblings of the
coming thunder and stood aghast. Even the political
agitators trembled for a moment at the prospect
they had created. My father therefore became
more anxious, more active, and less at home. At
length the storm burst. The indignant voice of fifteen
millions could no longer be controled. Then
followed that unparalleled era of romance and crime,
of heroism and pusillanimity. Then commenced the
first of a series, not yet completed, of modern popular
reaction against political oppression. We had,
ere this, removed to Paris, and we saw what has
been called the commencement of the Revolution.
But I must pass over the dreadful scenes which subsequently
passed before our eyes. They have now
long enjoyed an unenviable notoriety, forming alike
a warning to the oppressed and their oppressors.
Strange to say, after a little while, we were able to
hear the awful events around us with comparative
composure, so easy does our nature become accustomed
to circumstances. No doubt this was in a
great measure owing to the confidence we entertained
of the safety of our family. My brother was
one of the popular favorites, and so seemed Alfred.
My father, though conservative in his republicanism,
and an uncompromising opponent of infidelity, was
admired by all who held his opinions, and respected
by those who differed with him. Our relatives,
most of whom were aristocrats in sentiments as in
rank, had ere this emigrated to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Revolution gathered force as it rolled along,
and my father’s disappointment increased as he observed
the acts which accompanied its progress.
We now felt it was unsafe for him to remain, and at
our earnest wish, he appointed an old domestic to
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
take care of his property, and consented to leave
France with us for England. Alfred accompanied
us to Paris, and my parents agreed that we should
be immediately united, and that he should then accompany
us in our exile. A priest, an old acquaintance,
who had sought for shelter under our roof
from the popular excitement, was appointed to perform
the marriage ceremony. The gloom which
had lately hung heavily upon me now disappeared.
I was confident of a speedy release from further
trouble and looked forward to our future residence
in England with much anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning of the day fixed for my bridal at
length arrived. I remember I slept very little on
the preceding night. When I arose the day seemed
delightfully fine, which I looked upon as a favorable
omen. Habited in a plain white dress, I descended
to our little parlor, where Alfred and all the family,
except my father, were assembled at breakfast. The
latter, I was told, was absent on business relative to
our departure. The ceremony was not to take
place until one, and we highly amused ourselves
during the intermediate time, in projecting future
schemes, and building pretty castles in the air. My
sister drew a very charming picture of our English
residence—Alfred gave us amusing and extravagant
descriptions of the English—and I endeavored to
estimate how much I should enjoy the English
scenery, its picturesque cottages, its snug little gardens,
and the luxury of peace and safety. And then
Alfred drew me by his side, and whispered compliments
in my ear, and assured me that stores of happiness
awaited us. Thus pleasantly the time flew
on until the clock struck one, when the priest reminded
us that the hour for our wedding had arrived.
At that moment a knock was heard at the door,
which Annette declared was our father’s. The
missal was then opened, and my sister placed the
chairs in order. Then my heart began to palpitate,
and a nervousness come over me which young
ladies, I presume, are accustomed to experience upon
such occasions. As I was advancing with Alfred
toward the priest, I happened to turn my eyes to the
window fronting the street, where I saw my dear
father in the executioner’s cart, on its way to the
guillotine!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To describe the feelings which I experienced
when this dreadful sight presented itself, would be
impossible. Nearly forty years have passed since
then, during which I have witnessed many never-to-be-forgotten
scenes, and experienced many uncommon
trials, yet that moment stands out in greater
prominence than any other event of my life, and
even now my hand trembles and my eyes become
dim as the recollection of it returns to my memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon recovering from the insensibility which the
shock produced, I was met with another catastrophe,
no less appalling than its predecessor—the death of
my mother! It seems she also had observed my
father on his way to execution, and the sudden
fright operating upon a diseased heart, produced a
sudden and fatal attack. Thus the hour which I
fancied was to make me happy became the commencement
of a series of misfortunes; the day which
was to have rescued us from danger carried my father
to the scaffold and fitted my mother for the grave!
Truly says an old French proverb—“<span class='it'>L’homme propose,
et Dieu dispose.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My marriage was of course postponed. So soon
as we were able we made preparations for the burial
of our deceased parents. On the day after that duty
was accomplished, tidings reached us that our estates
were confiscated, adding poverty to orphanage.
Collecting our little stock of money and jewels, we
nevertheless determined to leave France for England.
It was agreed, for it was necessary, to make
our escape by different routes, so as to avoid notice
and lessen the possibility of detection. It was also
agreed that we should meet at a friend’s house in
London. Accompanied by my sister, we reached
Toulon, which was then in the hands of the royalists,
where we found an English ship which carried
us safely to England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my troubles did not end here. My sister was
naturally of a weak constitution, and the fatigues of
our journey, and the excitement consequent upon
our losses, had greatly increased her debility, so that
upon our arrival in London I found it necessary to
place her under medical treatment. The family
where we agreed to rendezvous were royalists, and
they had left for Germany, to join the invading army
against France. We were therefore in a strange
country, with an imperfect knowledge of its language,
friendless and almost moneyless. Oh! how
different was our condition to that which we a few
weeks previous had anticipated! Some time, however,
elapsed before I allowed these circumstances to
depress me. My nerves seemed to strengthen with
the increase of my difficulties—a faculty, which I
think, is peculiar to our sex, and which, alas! they
are often called upon to exercise. I also buoyed
myself up with the hope of the speedy arrival of my
brother and Alfred, and I used every means by
which they might become acquainted with our address.
At last my little resources were almost exhausted,
my poor sister still lingered unimproved,
and I had received no news of their arrival, nor intelligence
of their whereabouts. I had tried, but in
vain, to obtain employment, and I almost began to
despair of any relief but death. The doctor told me
that medicine was of no use to my sister, and recommended
nutritious diet, which I had not the means
of procuring. He, and the people with whom we
boarded, also importuned me for money, and payment
of what I owed deprived me of all I possessed.
We therefore felt it necessary to remove to a small,
ill-ventilated room, in the outskirts of the city.
After this my poor sister became worse. The want
of proper food, of pure air, and medical advice, aggravated
her disease. I fortunately, after very great
exertion, obtained employment in making fancy collars,
which by hard labor enabled me to earn about
one shilling a day. Deducting half of that sum for
rent, we had only three shillings per week to board
with. With this I used to purchase oatmeal, and
we converted it into what the Scotch call porridge.
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
Annette seemed at first to like it, but her partiality
for it speedily changed, and the only food she subsequently
cared for, which my means enabled me to
procure, was milk and toast. Her illness was also
aggravated by the disorderly persons who boarded
in the house, and when I entreated the landlord to
command silence, he roughly told me I was welcome
to leave if I felt uncomfortable. She was now
so weak that removal would have extinguished the
faint spark of life which remained, and I was therefore
compelled to submit to this annoyance. One or
two of our fellow-lodgers did take compassion on our
condition, and showed us a little kindness. An old
woman, named Grassett, the wife of a pensioner,
sometimes visited our room, and gave us a cup of
nice tea, or would wait on my sister while I worked
at my collars, or endeavored to snatch a little sleep.
We had also occasional visits from a pious French
priest, who, though he could not alleviate our sufferings,
often cheered us with his sympathy. My
sister lingered on for about ten months, sometimes
worse and sometimes better. On the evening of a
day in the month of December she seemed livelier
than I had seen her for a long time before, which
afforded me a hope of her ultimate recovery. She
sat up in her bed, and with her sweet voice endeavored
to convince me that there were happy days in
store for us, and of the strong probability of the
speedy arrival of Alfred and our brother. And then
she would kiss my care-worn cheeks, and smilingly
assure me that I had lost none of my beauty. I assumed
an assent to all she said, because I knew it
would afford her pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While conversing in this manner, the postman
arrived and handed me a letter. Pointing to the address
which was in French, and to the writing which
resembled my brother’s, she exultingly declared it
was his, and playfully demanded that I should never
more doubt her predictions. For a moment I fancied
it was his, and the bearer of good news, but the first
words, “Dear Miss,” dashed away all these expectations.
I however endeavored to hide my emotion,
because I was intently watched and incessantly
questioned about its contents. As I read on, the
particulars of my brother’s adventures became
gradually unfolded—at last the finale was reached,
he had been arrested within a few miles of the frontier,
and then met with the fate of his father. So
wrote the friend who obtained a few hurried words
from him previous to his execution, and who promised
him to communicate this intelligence to us.
But strange to say, when I reached this dreadful
part of the letter, my stupefied brain felt my sister’s
arms suddenly clasped around my neck, heard her
sob, as she kissed me, “poor dear Emma,” and then
remain silent. In a few minutes I felt somewhat
restored, I ventured a glance upon her face, and she
seemed to be asleep. I removed her arms, and as I
gently tried to awake her, the awful truth revealed
itself that she, too, had departed. Whether it was
produced by reading my brother’s fate upon my
countenance, or by any physical infirmity, is to me
a mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some hours must have elapsed before I returned
to consciousness. I awoke as from some horrible
dream, but the dreadful reality quickly returned.
And as I heard the thunder roaring and the rain
pouring without, and observed the gloom within,
the fatal letter on the door, and my dead sister by
my side, I became reckless with despair. Grief
refused to pay her tribute to misfortune, my heart
seemed to harden, my head seemed to burn. I
fancied Heaven and earth had conspired to injure
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A raging fever followed, accompanied with delirium,
and I was told, that as I lay under its influence
I would call upon my parents, my sister and my
brother, and entreat them to send for me. At other
times I upbraided Alfred for his absence, and then
expressed a confidence in his arrival, and framed
excuses for his delay. Anon I would promise to be
good to him, to wait upon and watch over him, to
make him happy and deserve his love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment the first gleam of reason returned,
I observed persons carrying my sister’s corpse from
the room, in a coffin composed of a few rough
boards, which seemed to be clumsily nailed together.
I recognized their object at once, and entreated that
I might be allowed to give her one last kiss before
they consigned her to the grave. With a little
grumbling they removed the lid, and as I pressed
my lips upon her cheek I truly envied her condition.
I then asked for a ringlet of her hair, but I was told
that they had all been cut off and sold to a hair-dresser
to meet the expenses of her funeral. A
choking sensation now seized me, I fell back and
buried my face in the bed-clothes, and my dead
sister was removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a little while I felt somewhat relieved. My
eyes—those safety-valves to a sorrow-stricken heart—became
suffused with tears for the first time since
my illness. I also now experienced that a some
thing was wanting; my conscience troubled me, but
I could not tell why or wherefore. I also startled
myself by conjecturing that my misfortunes were
intended for some wise purpose, and that that purpose
had some reference to myself. I reviewed my
past life, but I could not then remember any act of
mine which deserved punishment; indeed, I felt a
degree of complacency, because I fancied I was so
much better than many whom I remembered, and
had done my duty as a daughter, a sister, and as a
friend. But the feelings which produced these inquiries
wore off with my recovery; it was reserved
for a future period to make a deeper impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the people of the house extended a rough
kind of sympathy to me, and Mrs. Grassett continued
a constant attendant. One day she mentioned
the death of the kind old French priest who used to
visit us, and added that an English clergyman, who
visited the poor in the neighborhood, had made inquiries
and expressed a desire to see me. I may
here mention that my father descended from a Huguenot
family, and though they felt themselves
obliged to conceal their opinions after the edict of
Nantes, yet they continued to disseminate them
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
privately among their household. I felt, therefore,
little compunction in accepting this gentleman’s
offer, particularly at that moment, when I very much
needed some one with whom I could converse. On
the day after I consented to see him he called upon
me. His name was Bonner. In appearance he was
about fifty, with a pale, expressive and benevolent
face. He spoke French fluently, and alluded to my
recent loss with much delicacy and feeling. Although
I was then unable to comprehend all he said
upon religion, I soon felt at home with his manner,
and desired him to visit me as often as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as I regained a little strength, he recommended
me to seek the situation of governess, and
offered me a letter of introduction to a family with
whom he had a slight acquaintance, who, he believed,
were in want of one. I gladly accepted his
offer. The name of the family was Curtis. The
father had been a soap and candle manufacturer, but
had amassed wealth by successful speculations.
He was little more than forty in age—he had a stout
figure, a long, narrow face, a hooked nose, sharp,
deep-set eyes, and a broad mouth. His wife was a
daughter of a man of family, who had become poor
by extravagance, and who silenced his unmarried
creditors (so Mr. Curtis once told me) by presenting
them with his daughters. This occasioned him to
remark, in a moment of anger, that he had purchased
his wife for six hundred pounds. She had been
educated as a lady—that is, she could speak French
slightly, dance, sing, play on the piano, and read
novels. Her daughters were three in number. The
eldest, Jemima, when I first came, was sixteen; the
second, Dorothea, was fourteen; and the third, Angelica,
about twelve. I think they bore a greater
resemblance to their father than to their mother. I
will not particularize their features, because I fear I
might betray ill-feeling, which I fear has already
exhibited itself. I will merely observe, that though
not prepossessing, they were not ugly. They had
very great dislike to poverty, and much reverence
for wealth and rank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These young ladies, Mr. Curtis informed me, (for
Mrs. C. rarely troubled herself about such matters,)
were to be educated in music and drawing, French
and Italian, from ten to four each day, and during
the remainder I would be expected to occupy myself
in writing for him, or in needle-work for the
family. For these duties, if performed in a satisfactory
manner, I should receive at the end of the
year ten pounds. I thought the salary was rather
small, and I feared the labor would be too laborious,
but I dared not refuse to accept the offer,
because I doubted my ability to obtain a better situation,
and I dreaded a renewal of the privations I
had undergone. I therefore consented to enter upon
these duties on the following morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I arrived Mr. Curtis called me apart, and
observed that he had heard the French were generally
familiar and gay in their manner, but he would
warn me that any familiarity, or the slightest appearance
of freedom toward his daughters, would be
met with my immediate dismissal and forfeiture of
salary. I must confess, that when I heard this injunction,
a remembrance of my family mantled my
cheeks with a blush of pride, and it was with difficulty
that I could suppress a flood of tears which
were gushing to my eyes when I conjectured the
shock my poor mother would have felt had she been
a listener. I assured him, however, that I hoped
never to give them cause to complain of my rudeness
or discourtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this promise I was directed to my bed-room,
which was a garret, on the back part of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with no little nervousness that I commenced
my duties on the following morning. On entering
the class-room, I found the young ladies at their
lessons. They slightly returned my bow, and seemed
to regard me with a good deal of curiosity. At last
I summoned courage to inquire the branches they
were studying, and the progress they had made,
which request they complied with after a little
whispering and delay. I then laid before them the
system I purposed to pursue, to which they nodded
an approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I anticipated, I found my duties were laborious
and not very agreeable. The young ladies seemed
to think a governess ought not only to teach but to
do. If they found a branch of arithmetic difficult, an
explanation was insufficient, I was also expected to
solve its problems. If a picture which they were
copying ceased to be attractive, I had to complete it,
and then it was exhibited to visitors as a specimen
of their ability. In their music lessons I could rarely
prevail upon them to follow my directions, when, I
regret to say, I would exhibit a little annoyance, and
then they would leave the piano, and lodge a complaint
with their father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember upon one occasion I was very anxious
that Jemima should learn a very pretty French
ballad, which had been taught me by my mother. I
was, moreover, desirous that if she sang it at all, she
should sing it well. I took great pains in teaching,
but she seemed very indifferent about learning it.
When I urged her to practice it, she became impatient,
and flung the song into the fire. As it was a
copy made by my sister, I could not help weeping
when I saw it enveloped in flames. At this moment
Mr. Curtis entered the room in company with
two ladies. Jemima immediately gave him an incorrect
account of the cause of my tears, and he refused
to hear my explanation, and expressed his impatience
in seeing a governess giving herself such
airs about a valueless piece of music. His companions
nodded an assent to his remarks, and sympathized
with Miss Curtis for the annoyance, they
were sure, I occasioned her. Perhaps I was really
a little irritable at times, when I fancied they endeavored
to displease me; but on the whole, I am
sure, I was too easy and obliging, and I thought my
heart would have broken, when I heard them speak
so disparagingly of me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I may also mention another little reminiscence of
my musical experience. Mr. Curtis frequently gave
dinner-parties to gentlemen exclusively. On one
occasion, while sitting over their wine, one of the
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
company expressed a desire to hear Miss Curtis on
the piano. This wish was acquiesced in by the
others—and they accordingly entered the drawing-room
to have it gratified. She played a pot-pourri
of national airs. After the music had ceased, a
Scotch gentleman, who was somewhat beyond the
verge of sobriety, asserted that one of the airs—the
Blue Bells of Scotland—had been incorrectly played.
Mr. Curtis overheard the remark, and he replied that
if that was the case, the fault was mine—and he
ordered that I should be immediately sent for. You
may suppose I was very much astonished when I
entered the room, and found it filled with strange
faces, and that I was much more frightened when I
heard Mr. Curtis, addressing me in a loud voice,
demanding to know if I expected to be kept and paid
for incorrectly teaching music to his daughters?
Upon receiving a somewhat indistinct explanation, I
tremblingly endeavored—holding on to a back of a
chair for support—to convince him that the alterations
complained of were variations, and that the
fault, if any, was the composer’s, not mine. Some
of the gentlemen seemed to feel for my situation, and
endeavored to defend me; but this exasperated him
the more, and, with a very violent expression, he
ordered me to leave the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ran back to my little garret, stupefied and
affrighted. I believed I was the most unfortunate
being in the world. I looked out upon the stars,
which were now peeping through the heavens, and
imploringly asked if my troubles were never to
cease?</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning I communicated to Mr.
Curtis my desire to leave, and he replied that I might
do so whenever I paid him the money he had advanced
me to purchase some articles of clothing.
Our agreement was, he said, that I should be paid
provided I gave satisfaction; but as I had not done
so, I was not entitled to any remuneration. I had
no means for repaying him, I had no one to give
me advice or render me assistance, and therefore
I felt myself compelled to remain. The clergyman,
Mr. Bonner, who recommended the situation
to me, had left London for another part of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon accepting it, I agreed to do any writing
which Mr. Curtis might require, but I by no means
anticipated the quantity which he daily laid before
me. In the evenings it was necessary to take the
documents he gave me to copy to my chamber,
where I would work without intermission until my
task was completed, or until drowsiness and fatigue
compelled me to rest. Often during these occasions,
about the hour of midnight, the letters would swim
before my eyes; the glare of my candle became unbearable,
and I would feel a knocking sensation at
the back of my head. At these moments my imagination
was more active, and my sensibility more
acute. When I heard the sound of music, of mirth
and merriment in the rooms below, past scenes would
present themselves in painful distinctness; the merry
days of childhood, my happy home, and my kind
companions. My dear mother would return and
give me that look of mingled love and sympathy
which a mother only can bestow. My father and
brother would stand by my side, and whisper a word
of encouragement, and promise happier days. My
sister would come back, in her sick dress, and repeat
her last words, “Poor, dear Emma!” And then
the thought of Alfred would renew conflicting hopes
and fears. At one moment I would fancy he was
dead, and then convince myself he was alive, and
conjecture a favorable cause for his non-arrival.
And so I would go on, hoping and fearing, thinking
and dreaming, until my candle had sunk into the
socket, or my aching head made further labor impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was necessary that I should get up at an early
hour every morning, because, in addition to the
writing which I was unable to finish on the previous
evening, I had to dress the young ladies’ hair—a
more difficult undertaking than it is now. After this
Mr. Curtis required me to button-up his gaiters, because
his stoutness prevented him from doing it himself,
and he said I did it better than any of the
servants. If I had completed my writing, he would
give me a nod of approbation, and sometimes promise
the payment of my salary, for the period he had
formerly refused it. This would give me encouragement,
and make me labor cheerfully, for it held out
the hope of leaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heavy as my duties were, I should have felt them
much lighter if my diet had been more nutritious,
and my opportunities for out-door exercise more frequent.
With the exception of my visits to church
on Sundays, I could rarely obtain more than two
half-hours for walking through the week. My
stomach gradually became so weak, on account of
these disadvantages, that I was frequently unable to
taste the food laid before me. My meals were sent
to my room. The butter I had for breakfast and tea
was purchased by Mr. Curtis from one of his tenants,
and was called “pot-butter.” It smelt so disagreeable,
that I was forced to ask the girl to remove it
from my table. I also enjoyed the privilege of the
tea-leaves which came direct from the parlor, and
after a time, I was indulged with fresh tea on Sundays.
I considered this a great favor, because the
servants had to drink milk and water. My bread
was home-made, and I used to find it dark in color,
and difficult of digestion. At dinner I enjoyed a
joint, cold or hashed, which came from the parlor on
the preceding day, and what I left was then sent to
the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The close of the first year at length arrived. I repeated
to Mr. Curtis my wish to leave, because my
failing health was unequal to my duties. He stared
at me with apparent wonder, and then declared his
astonishment at my ingratitude, and his surprise at
my complaint. He endeavored to assure me that I
ought to feel highly indebted to him for the shelter
he had afforded me; and that my labors, for a governess,
were unusually light. By way of closing the
conversation, he again hinted, that if I did leave, I
could not expect any salary; and when I ventured
to ask the reason, he frowningly alluded to our relative
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
position, and censured my presumption in asking
him for an explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was conscious that I was undeserving such treatment,
but my defenseless condition rendered resistance
impossible, and I was obliged to remain another
year. When I communicated this intention to Mr.
Curtis, he gave me, to my surprise, half of the
amount due me, and promised the remainder when
my agreement terminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My duties continued unaltered, my health gradually
grew worse, and in a few months, I was laid
upon a bed of sickness. The family wanted to send
me to the hospital, but the doctor assured them I
was unable to bear the removal. He attributed my
illness to over-exertion, and a want of out-door exercise.
I had become pale and emaciated. A look
of premature old age had spread itself over my
countenance. My head seemed stupefied, melancholy
forebodings were constantly troubling me, and
I was frequently subjected to fits of crying. I had
lost all appetite for food, and all love for life. Like
Natalie, I longed “for the grave and nothing more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great change had come over me since my former
illness. The loneliness of my situation, and the
recollection of my losses, had frequently drawn my
attention to matters beyond the grave. I gradually
felt the necessity of studying as well as reading my
Bible; and I began to look forward to the Sabbath
more as a day for religious instruction than as a day
of rest. As the subject of religion became nearer
and dearer to me, I experienced a feeling of confidence
and resignation which I had never felt before.
I became less irritable when misfortune assailed me,
and looked upon it as intended for some wise purpose.
During my present sickness, I felt very much
the need of a clergyman, but for some unaccountable
reason, Mr. Curtis refused to allow one to be sent
for, and threatened my removal to a hospital if I
mentioned my wish to the physician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor was kind and skillful. By his attention,
and the diet he recommended, I was declared
convalescent after the lapse of nine weeks. But
when I had recovered I did not regain my former
strength, and was unable to go through with my
former duties. The family speedily saw this, and
Mr. Curtis then informed me that my services were
no longer required. He presented me with an account,
in which I was credited with nine pounds for
salary, on which he requested me to write a receipt.
After handing it to him he returned me another, in
which I was charged fourteen pounds for board, etc.,
during my illness. That, he remarked, extinguished
the amount due me, and left a balance of five pounds
in his favor, which, out of kindness, he did not intend
to charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This disappointment very much surprised me.
My physician refused to make any charge for his
attendance, and I never expected, as my illness was
produced in Mr. Curtis’s service, that he would be
less liberal. I was, therefore, once more thrust upon
a strange world, weak, moneyless and friendless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I left his house, I wended my way to my
former residence, for I had no where else to go to.
Upon arriving I was told that my old room was occupied,
and I was sent to one adjoining it. I felt
very lonely that day. The scenes around forcibly
brought back the recollection of my dead sister, and
recalled my subsequent disappointments and my
cheerless prospects. I did not know what to do, or
where to go. But there was not wanting, amid this
despondence, a degree of confidence in the superintendence
of a Higher Power, which I formerly did
not enjoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About nine in the evening Mrs. Grassett entered
my room, and expressed her delight at my return.
She said she would have called before, had she not
been engaged in waiting upon a sick stranger, who
occupied my former room, and who she did not think
would live much longer. When I inquired about
him, she replied that he was a foreigner, with an
unpronounceable name, and desired that I should visit
him with her, as I might be able to converse with
him in his native tongue. After a moment’s consideration
I consented to do so. I found the room greatly
altered. The walls were actually black with dust,
the plaster on the ceiling seemed on the point of falling
off, the window was covered with cobwebs, and
the bed-linen seemed very much in need of washing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found the patient asleep, his face buried in his
pillow. A moment or two afterward he awoke, and
asked, first in French and then in broken English,
for a little water. I turned to observe his features,
and notwithstanding his hollow cheeks, his distended
eye-balls, and his disheveled hair, I recognized my
long expected Alfred. My surprise was so great
that I sprang forward, threw my arms around his
neck, and alternately laughed and wept for joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was suffering from typhus fever, and had been
confined to his bed for eleven days. I gathered from
him subsequently, that the last time he saw my brother
was when we parted in Paris—that he did not
hear of his death until some months after it occurred—that
he had been compelled to remain in France
some time after we left—that he had been in London
for two or three months before I saw him, but he
was unable to find me—that by some accident he
had lost the money he brought with him to England,
and was driven by necessity to seek for shelter in
the place where I found him. I asked for some further
information, not from mere curiosity, but from
the interest I took in every thing which concerned
him. He chided me for doing so, because it implied
a want of confidence, and the fear of exhibiting that
was sufficient to stop all further inquiries on my part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment my surprise abated I commenced to
wait upon him. I had three shillings and some odd
pence in my pocket, which I placed into Mrs. Grassett’s
hands, to purchase what necessaries she could
with it for our patient. I now forgot all the trials
which a few minutes ago weighed so heavily upon
me; and with a lighter heart than I had felt for a
long time before, I endeavored to put the room in
order, and to add to his comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a few days my little sum was exhausted.
I then obtained fifteen shillings from a pawnbroker
for a gold case in which my mother’s miniature had
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
been set. This supported us for nearly ten days,
and before the expiration of that time I succeeded,
after much exertion, in obtaining collar work. I
labored upon this principally during the moments
Alfred slept, and earned from five to six shillings per
week. With the exercise of economy, and the sale
of the remaining trinkets which belonged to me and
my sister, I was able to succeed pretty well, and to
support Alfred somewhat comfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly six weeks elapsed before he recovered.
His sickness made him a little irritable, and sometimes
my inexperience made me displease him. My
anxiety to please him sometimes confused me, and
he would censure me for my stupidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly four weeks Mrs. Grassett and myself
would wait upon him in turns of twelve hours each.
His sickness required unremitting attention, but I
can truly say my labor about him was indeed a labor
of love. The hope of sparing him one pang made
the longest day seem short; and the hope that his
life might be spared gave an unqualified pleasure to
my exertions. Oh! how often during dark nights,
when all eyes but mine were closed in sleep, have I
watched his features, to seek for traces of returning
health, as if my life depended upon his. Every expression
of pain he exhibited had a sympathetic influence
upon myself; every appearance of revival
upon his looks spread a corresponding change upon
mine own. And when gentle slumber had crept over
him, I would kneel by his side, and in a subdued
voice pour forth a supplication to Heaven, that his
life might be spared. I felt as if he was the last
and only link which bound me to earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever an opportunity offered, I drew his attention
to religion. Sometimes he would listen to
me with attention, and at others he begged me to be
silent on account of his debility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally I tried to amuse him by singing some
of our old French ballads, when the evening was too
far advanced for my collar work. At other times I
read interesting works, from a neighboring circulating
library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he became better, and we were to be
married so soon as he could leave his room. Then
hope once more drew back the curtains of despair.
The future brightened again. During his sickness
he seemed dearer to me than he ever was before. I
felt as if he was now my own, to love and cherish,
to live for, and, if need, to die for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As his strength increased he agitated himself in
conjecturing how he could obtain a livelihood; but I
endeavored to convince him of my ability to earn a
very comfortable maintenance for us both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the second day after he left his room, and three
days previous to that fixed for our marriage, a letter
reached him from Bonn, enclosing some money, and
communicating the death of his uncle, who had bequeathed
to him all his property. The receipt of
this news gave us much joy. I looked upon it as an
unequivocal guaranty that my troubles were ended.
It may have been selfish in me, but I confess I felt a
little disappointment when he informed me that this
communication necessitated a further delay of our
marriage until his return from Germany. I fancied
that as we had been separated so long we should not
be parted again so quickly, but he strove to convince
me that his immediate absence was necessary, and I
at last cheerfully assented. He left on the day
which had been fixed for our wedding, and it was
agreed he should return on the following month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a few days after his departure I again fell
sick, arising, perhaps, from my late exertions and
insufficient rest. It was accompanied with the same
loss of appetite, nervous fits of crying, lowness of
spirits, and occasional attacks of delirium, which I
had formerly suffered from. My sane moments,
however, were enlivened by pleasing anticipations
of Alfred’s return; and I even felt grateful he was
ignorant of my sickness, because I believed it would
spare him much pain and anxiety. I did not recover
so soon as I expected. My physician did not seem
to understand my complaint so well as his predecessor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four weeks had now elapsed since Alfred departed,
and I heard no news of his return. Three or four
days more elapsed without intelligence, and I became
alarmed. At length a letter arrived, addressed
to me in his hand—and my heart throbbed with joy.
I felt so delighted, that I committed, what some will
call a piece of extravagance, that is, I kissed the address,
because I was convinced it was his writing.
I then hurriedly broke the seal and began to read
the contents. The first paragraph informed me that
he had taken possession of his uncle’s property, and
that it was more valuable than he had supposed, and
was, I fancied, conveyed in cooler language than I
expected. The next paragraph had reference to
matters of little importance, but as I read on, another
communication rose up, which made the blood freeze
in my veins, and seemed to suspend the beating of
my heart. It told me that now our relative conditions
were greatly changed—that he feared our dispositions
were incompatible—that our marriage was
impossible. As I read on with a brain throbbing
and burning, with a bosom struggling between doubt
and despair, I observed an invitation to reside with
him, and a promise to give me a settlement if I subsequently
desired a separation. I think one more
paragraph concluded the letter, but I could read no
further. I alternately laughed and cried. I declared
it was all a vile forgery, and then something told me
all was true. I declared it was a dream, but anon
the dread reality stared me in the face. At last
every thing seemed to disappear. For many a long
day reason deserted me.</p>

<hr class='tbk113'/>

<p class='pindent'>About two years after, I felt as if I had awakened
from a sleep, and I found myself in a very respectably
furnished room, with an elderly lady, who was apparently
watching me. I had a somewhat confused
remembrance of both her and the room, though I
could not divine her name, nor remember how I had
become acquainted with her. She also appeared as
much surprised as myself, from the earnest and dubious
look she directed toward me. She arose from
her chair, and introduced herself as Mrs. Burnett, I
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
hardly knew what to say, or what inquiry to make.
After a moment, I ventured to ask if I was not staying
in her house—to what circumstance I was indebted
for that favor, and whether I had not been
suffering from insanity?—for that dreadful truth
gradually came to my mind. Perceiving that I was
restored to reason, she answered all my inquiries,
and communicated much more than I anticipated.
She informed me how that my father’s old and
faithful steward had by some means prevented the
confiscation of his property from being executed—how
that he had, a few months after my departure,
disposed of it, and escaped to London with the proceeds,
for the purpose of handing it to me. How
that he used great exertions, after his arrival, to find
me, and in the midst of them fell sick and died. Before
his decease, he lodged the money in the hands
of her husband, who was a banker, together with
every information he could give which might lead
to my discovery. That Mr. Burnett had renewed
his efforts, but after several months he abandoned
them as useless. That shortly after he was appointed
to be one of the inspectors of a metropolitan
lunatic asylum, and at one of his visits there, he
found an inmate bearing my name. Upon making
inquiries from the keeper, and at the house where I
had boarded, (where he examined some books and
papers which belonged to me,) he satisfied himself
that I was the person whom he and the steward had
sought for; and as he heard a favorable character of
me, he removed me to his house, in the hope of
affording better treatment than I was likely to receive
in the asylum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may suppose this explanation very much surprised
me; but the unexpected recovery of the
proceeds of my father’s property did not produce
much gratification. I was not sorry I now possessed
a competence, though I did not feel glad. I felt very
grateful to my deliverers, and to Him by whom my
life had been spared; but it was accompanied with a
recklessness and indifference about my future prospects.
My disposition also seemed to have changed
into a settled sadness, which has never since altogether
left me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My kind friends wished me to remain with them,
but, with many thanks, I declined their invitation.
I wanted to leave London, and upon that determination
I came to Cornwall, and occupied the little
cottage where we became acquainted.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>Many years have passed since these trials happened;
and as the sweetest perfumes are derived
from the bitterest drugs, so these dark clouds have
produced many bright and sunny days. True, they
are associated with painful reminiscences, but they
have been followed with incalculable advantages.
Amid their severest strokes I can now recognize the
hand of a just but benevolent Father. If in my subsequent
career I could bear disappointment without
discontent, and misfortune without repining; if I
could feel resignation suppressing impatience, and
contentment controlling ambition, I owe it to the
struggles which I have endeavored to describe. It
is in the rugged vale of tribulation that the path to
human happiness is found.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>People</span> seem to have an idea that facts are every
thing in the business of the world—the only considerations
in the philosophy of human progress.
Opposed to what is merely imaginary, facts are allowed
to have much dignity. Your practical reasoners
look for facts; facts “are the jockies for
them”—such as they can see, hear, handle, or
demonstrate; while the imaginations are mostly held
synonymous with the worthless, the unsubstantial
and the ridiculous. They seem to say in the spirit
of one of Congreve’s characters—we forget which—“fiddle-faddle,
don’t tell me of this and that and
every thing in the world; but give me mathematical
demonstration.” Now we do not go so far as the
philosopher Bayle, who, on the other hand, affected
to laugh at mathematical demonstration; but we
think, “under leave of Brutus and the rest,” that
facts do not seem, and have not seemed to be so exclusively
essential to “the cosmogony of the
world,” to the history and progress of mind and the
general business of things, as some solid authorities
think. Without troubling our heads, in this gossiping
paper, with the subtleties of Berkley and others,
who knock all creation into the compass of a man’s
perceptions—establish the column of the unsubstantial
universe on the pentagonal base of the senses—we
have an idea that a vast amount of the fictitious
and imaginary is blended with our regular business
of being, doing and suffering. Human nature has, in
all times, contrived a little gilding, to make the bitter
pill of life go down. Tasso truly says—in his Invocation
to the Virgin Mary for a muse—at the opening
of his “Gerusalemme Liberata”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not alone have the edges of the cup of life been
touched in this way, but the contents of it have
always been dashed with large doses of the same
emollient. Reality is not such a delightful thing,
after all. The false and the phantasmal have ever
been considered the necessary complements, as it

There is a sudden solitude in the world. The beautiful
is vanished, and the hard, blank remnant of
things is full of gaps, and desert places, disastrous
flaws and a strange silence. There is nothing now,
but facts in this macrocosm. But, believe us, ’tis a
very rude, cold place to live in—much worse than
ever it was before; and that—in the opinion of the
pale pessimist over the way there—was bad enough
in all conscience. They who first found out this
world, and roamed about on it, had scarcely called it
very good when they began to make it better, by
peopling its too extensive solitudes—creating phantasms
and imaginations for it, where there were
none before. The unclothed reality of things was
too bare and blank, beautiful as it was, for the first
human beings that walked the earth. They looked
to the elements, and the infinite host of heaven, and
following their unanswerable instincts, they began
to make mysteries, airy fabrics and visions. They
imagined a god for the cope and the clouds of the
firmament, and he wielded the thunderbolts from a
high mountain; another, shaped after the most perfectly
formed of men, resided in the sun,</p>

What a throng of splendid deeds, of heroic and beautiful
figures—demigods, warriors, kings—bright women
and brave men, moving in gorgeous panorama
over the vast back-ground of antiquity—is extinguished
in the darkness! The creations of the ancient
poets and imaginative writers have filled up a

them would be a blank and lost to the human mind,
as much as the pre-Adamite chaos is. What a disinheritance

<p class='noindent'>and the wandering Ulysses, seeing strange shores
and cities, and the varying manners of men! Not
alone would much be wanted in the want of these
venerable works, but in the want of all that literature
which they inspired and gave rise to in after
time. The succeeding poets and dramatists of
Greece and Rome drew light from Homer, as Milton’s
stars did in their golden urns from the sun.
They took his historic imaginations and characters
as their models, and reproduced them in forms which
the world will not willingly let die, and which it
prizes nearly as much as the Institutes and Pandects
of Justinian, or any thing else of that authentic and
substantial kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To come to our own familiar literature, the fictions
of our insular or continental writers are as
favorably and generally remembered as the historic
facts of the English-speaking peoples. In our genial
moments, when the mind desires to be refreshed or
pleased it will revert, with an almost universal preference,
to what is imaginary, or adorned with the
graces of imaginative literature; and half the world
regard with as much attention the men and women
of Shakspeare and Scott as those of Hume and Prescott.
And how intimately and lovingly we give our
interest to the words and actions of these imaginary
beings! What a world of thought and life is in the
dramas of Shakspeare! There is the venerable
Lear, driven out into the storm, and talking the
finest philosophy to the wild elements, that so feelingly
persuade him what he is; and Hamlet, so sententious
in his antic disposition; the fair Ophelia, and
the prosy old courtier, Polonius; and the immortal
bed-presser, and huge hill of flesh—the greatest liar
and the greatest favorite in the world; and Macbeth,
with his terrible hags on the heath, and his more
terrible wife; and Richard, wooing Lady Anne, or
fighting desperately his last battle. Then there are
the witty and adventurous Rosalind, and</p>

Torquilstone, the Black Knight, fighting as if ten
men’s strength were in his single arm; and the beautiful

back so vividly the old pomp and circumstance
of the feudal times! We shall never forget

there found all our vague feelings of romance and
dreams of knightly doings put into such spirit-stirring
expression. Then how true is the picturesque
bravery of Fergus McIvor—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of Scotland, for ages, from the reign of
Fergus, and of Ireland from the days of Heber, Heremon
and Ith, down to the conquest of the country by
Strongbow, are just as fanciful as the metrical romances
of Scott and Moore. Then, for the annals
of Greece; Herodotus, the patriarch of history, sets
down almost every thing he hears from the lying
priests of Egypt, or that he can gather from vague
tradition; and people don’t exactly know whether
to call the Cyropædia of Xenophon a romance or an
authentic narration. Plutarch romances at times
like the Scuderis. An old English author, Taylor,
says, of his fallacies and blunders in the lives of the
orators—<span class='it'>mendaxille Plutarchus qui vitas oratorum
dolis et erroribus consutas, olim conscribillavit</span>.
Neibuhr has got into our old history of Rome and
laid about him like an iconoclast. He destroys a
crowd of our beliefs, and makes a solitude in the first
ages of Rome—so wonderful and picturesque in our
school-boy days. He makes a solitude and calls it
truth. He demolishes Mars, Rhea Sylvia, Romulus
and Remus and the Wolf—Numitor, Evander, and so
forth. Under the flourishing of his pen they make
themselves into thin air in which they vanish. Then
the Tarquins, their insolence and expulsion; Lars
Porsenna of Clusium, the siege of Rome, Cocles on
the Bridge and Scævola at the flaming Altar—all are
inventions of Fabius Pictor, Ennius, Nævius, and
others. This portion of the history of Rome, says
the German, should be called the Lay of the Tarquins,
and is just as authentic as the Lay of the Nibelungen!
“Livy’s <span class='it'>pictored</span> page,” (if we may be
permitted to make a critical emendation of Byron’s
phrase in the spirit of Bishop Warburton’s Notes on
Shakspeare,) is allowed to be just as fallible as it is
brilliant. Thus we have a vast amount of what is
called ancient history confounded with the professed
creations of fanciful minds; and there does not seem
to be any very marked difference between Agamemnon
or Ajax, and Cecrops or Codrus; between
Æneas or Dido, and Numa or Clelia—they are all
equally distinct or indistinct. Scott’s King Richard,
singing a roundelay and exchanging a buffet with the
Clerk of Copmanhurst, is as firm on the canvas as
Alfred baking his cakes, or Canute sitting on a chair
to rebuke his flatterers on the sea-shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as regards the more modern and authentic
annals of history, we do not think they have
paid much more respect to the actual truth of things
than do the fictionists. Sir Robert Walpole used to
say to his friends, “Don’t read history; that must
be false.” And Sir Walter Raleigh, looking from the
window of his prison in the Tower, and witnessing
a quarrel in the court-yard or the street, and the after-testimony
of the by-standers respecting it, was
tempted, it is said, to throw his History of the
World into the fire, in despair of ever being able to
gather any thing like truth from conflicting authorities.
And, certainly, the differences of historians—their
doubts concerning motives, and their disagreements
concerning facts, tend to give us very unsettled
ideas of history in general. Writers have
sent Col. Kirke down to us from James the Second’s
reign with a very black and bloody renown. But
he was not half so black as he was painted by the
whigs; and the story of the poor girl whose husband
he hanged before her eyes, in the morning, though she
had dearly purchased his life on Kirke’s own terms, is
pronounced by Ritson to be an impudent and bare-faced
lie. The story is much older than Kirke.
Richard the Third is also one of the historical reprobates;
though it is not unlikely that the young
princes were not murdered in the Tower, and that
Perkin Warbeck was really the prince after all; as
truly as the surreptitious, warming-pan prince is
known to have been the true son of James the
Second, in spite of the Protestant historians. Then
there are Jack Cade and Wat Tyler; these have
been receiving cruel wrong at the hands of the annalists.
They dared, in an age when the rights of
the people were imperfectly understood, and the influence
of the feudal system still strong in the nation,
to take up arms and go to war with the king and the
nobles for liberty! Their sufferings and provocations
were undeniable, and their spirit was certainly heroic—kindred
to that which glowed in the bosoms of
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
Melchthal, Furst, and Stauffacher, at the Brunnens
of Grutli. The Swiss peasants were successful, and
are held in honorable remembrance forever. But the
Englishmen failed, and are set up as scarecrows and
<span class='it'>Indibria</span>, upon the field of history. Poor Tyler and
Cade were animated by the same kind of blood
which boiled in the face of a tyrant at Naseby,
Marston Moor, Dunbar, and elsewhere—which
warmed the hearts of the exiles on the cold rock
of Plymouth, and flowed so freely at Lexington and
Bunker Hill. We should honor these English rebels—in
spite of history, and in spite of Shakspeare. It
is remarkable to see this myriad-minded man, so full
of the finer humanities of our nature, yet incapable
of sympathizing with the cause and feelings of the
mass of the lower classes. But Shakspeare was a
man of his era—to which, with an astonishing and
happy wizardry, he obliged chronology and human
nature to conform; he dreamed as little of the later
evangils of democracy as he did of the Daguerreotype
and the electric telegraph. In this way Cade,
Richard, and a thousand others are in the hands of
the historians, tricked out as much in the colors of
imagination as in those of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man can be sure of the lesser details of the
annals, though he may put faith in some of their
great facts. We are not indisposed to allow that
there was a man named Julius Cæsar; though
whether he ever said, <span class='it'>Quid times? vehis Cæzarem</span>,
in the boat, or <span class='it'>Et tu Brute!</span> when the republicans
set upon him in the senate-house, is not quite so
credible. Most of these picturesque properties of
character or fact, so to speak, are furnished by the
fancies and after-thoughts of the narrators, or fabricated
wilfully for a purpose. We need not go very
far back in history to discover the truth of this. In a
late memoir (Achille de Vaulabelle’s) of the “Two
Restorations,” we are told that an old story of the
consternation of the members of the Directory, on its
violent dissolution by Bonaparte, in 1800, was a false
one. There was no hurry-skurry, nor jumping out
of windows, any more than when Oliver Cromwell
put an end to the Long Parliament. Again, that
glorification made on the sinking of the <span class='it'>Vengeur</span>, in
an engagement with the English fleet, during the
first French revolution, has been latterly put out of
countenance. The story in France was, that, being
terribly damaged, this ship sunk with all on board,
her flag flying, and the crew shouting, “Long live
the republic!” Carlyle adopted this version in his
history, and makes quite a cartoon of it, in his own
outlandish phraseology. But on the appearance of
the story in an English work, a naval officer who
witnessed the affair of the <span class='it'>Vengeur</span>, wrote a letter to
the Times, in which he stated that, instead of going
down with true republican devotion, the poor French
sailors, small blame to them! jumped overboard, and
tried to save themselves, and that some hundreds of
them were rescued in the British boats. That message,
said to have come from the dying Dessaix to
Bonaparte, on the field of Marengo, (“Tell the First
Consul I die regretting I can no farther serve him
and France,”) was fabricated in the bulletin by the
aforesaid consul himself. The story of the Duke of
Wellington lying in the hollow square of the Guards
at Waterloo, and, on the advance of the French,
crying, “Up, Guards, and at them!” is as untenable
as our own famous saying—“A little more grape,
Captain Bragg!” or the military speeches of the
great generals of antiquity, as recorded by Tacitus,
Sallust, Cæsar, and the rest of the writers. Then,
as regards great facts, different nations give different
accounts. Ask who gained Waterloo? “We did,”
say the Prussians. “We gave vast assistance,” say
the Belgians. Ask John Bull, or rather, don’t; his
answer would be rather brief than polite. We should
like to see a history of the campaigns in Greece of
Darius, Xerxes, and Mardonius, written by Persians.
All history is more or less deserving of Sir Robert
Walpole’s designation. Hume, in one of his letters
to Robertson, alluding to the publication of Murdin’s
State Papers, which threw unexpected light
upon the annals, exclaims, “We are all in the
wrong!” And, indeed, Hume himself is among
those to whom we are mostly indebted for the imaginative
character of history. He had little of the
industry of Gibbon, and trusted very much to his own
sagacity for his views. He was also a tory, and became,
in his scorn of whiggery, the apologist of the
Stuarts. His history is charming as a composition,
but errs in its colorings of facts and its conclusions
from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagination, as we have said, seems the complement
of the world of facts and things, in all mental
exercises, except the logical and mathematical. If
we contemplate nature it enhances what we behold.
The mountains, rivers, forests, and the elements that
gird them round about, would be only blank conditions
of matter, if the mind did not fling its own
divinity around them. Nature was thus endowed
from the beginning—when men heard voices in the
winds, and the supernatural inhabitants of terra
firma,</p>

<p class='noindent'>And the modern lovers of nature, though they no
longer recognize the mythologic people of the ancient
beliefs in her picturesque wildernesses, clothe them
with the attributes of the mysterious abstract power
which is over all things. And, in the towering of her
peaks, the murmur of her forests and seas, the roar of
her storms, the singing of her nightly stars, they find
revelations and prophecies of higher and farther existences.
In this respect, the modern poetry of nature
has a nobler scope and purer inspiration than the
ancient. Wordsworth and Byron speculate more
sublimely than Lucretius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another sense, the imagination materially imposes
upon facts. In contemplating cities, works of
art, ruins, or scenes of nature, we almost always appreciate
them for the associations that belong to
them—the imaginations they excite. Look at a gray
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
bleak sort of plateau between mountains and the
sea, and you see little to admire. But let somebody
say, “that is Marathon!” while the blood thrills at
the name, a flood of glory flashes over the immortal
ground; the air is thick with phantoms—</p>

<p class='noindent'>It is this quality of the imagination which gives old
countries their superior attractions when compared
with new soils. At the sight of battle-fields, religious
houses, cathedrals, castles, either in ruins or
otherwise, we are pleased in calling up a crowd of
shadows from the dust, and finding a sort of mysterious
companionship with them during our passing
reveries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Campbell says very well, that distance lends enchantment
to the view, and it is generally true of
the human mind that it regards the past with a
feeling of tenderness—a disposition to make the best
of it. There is a certain charm in Time, whom we
regard as the dominator of us all; and the ruins or
remnants of any thing speak an impressive warning
of our own evanescent fate. That belief in the
good old times is an instinct too strong for the philosophy
of most of us. We have a thousand proofs
that they were rude, bad, ignorant times. But the
poetry of our nature will not be reasoned with, and
we believe with the bard—</p>

stream, a forest, a hill—nothing more. The nameless
savages had the place from the beginning, and
the solitude. The other is a tradition, a romance,
a memory. In the valley is the legendary well, and
the fairy ring; by the stream is the fortalice of the
feudal period, or the abbey dwindled to a few ivied
walls and the oriel, on the site of a bloody battle

<p class='noindent'>They receive all their witchery from the imagination
of him who surveys them. This faculty is potentially
mingled with all that is most real in nature;
nay, it would seem to be as much a reality as any
thing else we call such. The preacher calls the
world a vain shadow, and the Berkleyan philosopher
calls it a huge accident of the five senses; and
Shakspeare is inclined to think there is nothing
that is but thinking makes it so. The practical
men, therefore,—the directors of railways, the
managers of stock, and the owners of electric telegraphs
cannot be considered to have matters all to
themselves. The poet and the romancist control as
much of the “thick rotundity of the world” as they;
and certainly the most enchanting portion. Schiller
gives us in an admired lyric, the idea that the imaginative
being was forgotten by Jove in the distribution
of the earth; but received a general invitation
to the Court of Olympus. Our nether “maker,”
or “finder,” does still, of course, avail himself of this
privilege; but not as one without alternative. He
has a great share and dominion in all sublinary
things; and his castles in the air may be found as
firmly fixed, after all, and as well tenanted, as any
existing on any other element.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE TABLEAU.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> curtain arose and a murmur of applause
greeted the beautiful scene that appeared. An open
window unclosed on a valley sleeping in the moonlight,
and the over-arching heavens glittering with
its quiet stars. Beside the window leaned the lady,
her head half-turned from the page who knelt at her
feet, and clasped her hand between his tremulous
fingers: and she—oh how divinely fair was that
girl! She represented one of a royal race, and well
did she look the character she had assumed. The
turn of the graceful head, the curve of the red lip
belonged to the royalty of beauty, and there was a
pretty air of condescension in the attitude she
assumed toward the kneeling youth; while he
looked up to her and sent forth his soul in the deep
gaze he bent upon her face. The first fond dream
of the enthusiast’s heart was realized, and his spirit
bowed in homage before the ideal of his young
imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain fell—the page raised her hand to his
lips and passionately kissed it. A faint flush came
up to the cheek of the girl, and a half-mocking
smile flitted across her crimson lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget, young sir, that we are only <span class='it'>acting</span>.
One would suppose from your manner that you are
really in earnest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone jarred on the highly excited feelings of
the youth, and he sprang to his feet, the warm blood
mantling his fine features with its sunny glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your pardon, Miss Selwyn,—I forgot that we
were acquaintances of but a day’s standing: yet if
you could read the dreamer’s heart, you would not
wear that smile which seems to mock my enthusiasm.
You see before you a boy in years, but if
the age of man may be measured by the wild aspirations—the
burning hopes of a heart whose reveries
are as passionate realities, I am not a mere youth.
Oh beautiful,”—he continued, again kneeling before
her, “my soul bows before the incarnation of a
lovely spirit, in a form fitted to enshrine it. I feel
that it is so, for <span class='it'>He</span> who made you so gloriously
lovely, would not place a cold or selfish heart in so
exquisite a casket. My fancy has pictured such
forms among the angels of heaven, and my unskillful
hand has essayed to sketch them, but ever without
success. When we met, my heart at once went
forth to greet its predestined idol, and I felt that my
dreams had found a reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl who listened to this wild rhapsody with
a little fear and more surprise, was one who had
been reared amid the artificial refinements of life,
and it was probably the first genuine burst of feeling
which had ever met her ear. The daughter of a
man of wealth, and a mother devoted to fashion, her
education had been carefully intended to model the
character of the future belle. The parents looked
on her unrivaled beauty with pride, and the vain
mother anticipated the renewal of her own triumphs
in the person of her daughter. Flattered and spoiled
from childhood, it was quite wonderful that one
natural trait should still have remained in her vain
little heart; but nature sometimes asserts her power
where art has done most to arrest and deface her
beauties. Thus it was with Julia Selwyn. Sincere
feeling even to the world-hardened ever finds an echo
in the breast, and the mocking smile died from her
lips as she felt the deep charm of the young stranger’s
singular avowal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two had met that morning for the first time.
Arthur Mervin was the son of one of Mr. Selwyn’s
early friends, who had that day arrived in Philadelphia,
with a letter of introduction from his father,
containing a request that Mr. Selwyn would aid the
youth in obtaining admittance into the studio of a
distinguished painter, as his pupil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment of his arrival, a party was rehearsing
the tableau which were to be presented
in the evening at a splendid entertainment, given in
honor of Miss Selwyn’s <span class='it'>debut</span> in the world of
fashion. The most important one;—the one in
which the beauty was to burst on the enraptured
eyes of her father’s guests in all her loveliness, was
the lady and the page—and—oh, dire disappointment!
The young cousin who was to enact the
page, had been seized with an inflammatory sore
throat, and his medical attendant positively prohibited
his leaving his room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was to be done? Mrs. Selwyn glanced
over the list of her young acquaintances, and could
not find one to appear in the tableau with her fair
daughter, who would not look coarse when placed
in comparison with her refined loveliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wished the tableau to be perfect—to be
talked of as the most beautiful one of the season,
and, in the midst of her perplexity, when her
husband ushered in the son of his friend, one glance
at his graceful person and fine features convinced
her that she need look no farther,—the page was
found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her daughter was sent for, and after an animated
conversation of half-an-hour, the lady found means
to introduce her request so naturally and gracefully,
that after a moment’s hesitation, with a glance at
Julia and a bright flush of the cheek which spoke
volumes, Mervin consented to play the part of the
page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How would that worldly mother have shrunk
from allowing him admittance within the charmed
circle of her daughter’s fascination could she have
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
divined the effect this casual introduction was to
have on that daughter’s future life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The son of a farmer of moderate means who was
encumbered with a large family, it appeared too
absurd to guard against Mervin’s admiration. Julia
was born to be admired: she had been educated to
glitter in the sphere of fashion, and understood her
own position too well to allow her feelings to
become interested in a mere flirtation with an
obscure artist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young painter was full of genius and enthusiasm;
the walls of his studio were ornamented
with sybils, angels, and Madonnas, in each of which
might be recognized a striking resemblance to the
face of his young love, and his passionate soul
poured forth his adoration in “thoughts that breathe
and words that burn.” The homage of genius gave
an eclat to her daughter which gratified the vanity
of Mrs. Selwyn, who fancied that she had sufficiently
warned Julia against allowing her heart to become
interested, by speaking of the utter impossibility that
Mervin should for years be in a situation to ask her
to share his destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this adulation is very pleasant my love,”
said she, “and makes you the envy of many a fair
rival, but remember it is only as incense to your
vanity that it must be regarded. Mr. Mervin is
clever, and has talent enough to make a very agreeable
addition to our <span class='it'>soirees</span>, but a suitor to you it is
quite impossible he should aspire to become.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rose faded from the cheek of Julia in an instant.
“He is gifted with extraordinary abilities, mother.
A distinguished path is before him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—but think of the years of toil that must intervene.
The best portion of his life must be devoted
to his exacting profession, and when the pulse is fevered
with application—the eyes dimmed, and the
hair blanched with time, he may be what is called
great; but the spirit of life, of love, and hope, will
be exhausted in the struggle. From the dim waste
of the past, the voice of fame will sound but as a
funeral dirge, wailed over the courage and enthusiasm
which bore him upward and onward in his
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disappointment must come to all, mother; but in
the exciting occupation you describe there is much
happiness to be found. The days of all must fall
into the ‘sere and yellow leaf,’ but the man of
genius can at least look back with pleasure to his
toil, and reflect with just pride on the rewards he has
won. Ah how superior are such memories to those
hoarded by the mere butterflies of fashion, of a petty
triumph over some insignificant person whose wealth
lifts them into ephemeral notoriety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child—Child! how you are running on! Your
cheek is flushed, and your eyes sparkling.—This
will never do. I hope this young painter has not
made what romantic young ladies call ‘an impression’
on your heart, for in that case my doors must
be closed on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia was calm in a moment. The pupil of the
fashionable Madame Lecompte had been assiduously
taught the art of controling the outward show of
emotion, and young as she was, Julia Selwyn did
not shame the lessons of her preceptress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear mother, how can you have such a
fancy! Mr. Mervin does not make love to me
without I construe his verses into declarations.
Do you fear that I shall be so unmaidenly as to give
my heart unsought? He knows that a union between
us is impossible, but that does not prevent
this frail fading beauty from being his inspiration
and his muse. A few fleeting years, and some
younger and fairer face will claim his homage,
while I shall pass down the stream of time only remembered
as the <span class='it'>ci-devant</span> belle. When his fame
is at its zenith, I shall be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad that you have so much common sense,
my dear. When we can speak calmly of being forgotten
by an admirer, it is a sure sign that the feelings
are not deeply interested in him. You were never
intended for the wife of a poor man, and there is one—but
I must not betray your father’s plans. He will
never force you to accept any one who is disagreeable
to you, but there is a person in view who is so
suited in age, fortune, and in short, every thing, that
we have set our hearts on seeing you his bride. I
will not name him, lest the knowledge of our wishes
should make you shy. I shall leave him to make
his own way, love—no questions—I am silent as
death. Good-bye—I must see the new case of millinery
opened at Madam ——’s. I will bring you a
Parisian hat of the newest style.”</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>Julia buried her face in her hands and remained in
deep and painful thought. She had instinctively
known all that her mother had just expressed relative
to Mervin; yet she would not reflect on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year had passed since the first impassioned
declaration of the young painter. His lips had uttered
no word of love in that time, but his devotion
of manner had expressed all that the most exacting
mistress could have asked. Julia fancied that she
received his homage merely as the incense due to
her unrivaled charms—that her own heart was still
unscathed—yet why did she listen for his step, and
turn listlessly away from her usual occupations until
shared by him? Why did the faint crimson steal to
her cheeks as he sat beside her and spoke in those
low, earnest tones, so different from the <span class='it'>persiflage</span>
of the set in which she habitually lived? Enthusiasm
ever finds in the hearts of the young a chord
which vibrates to the touch of him who possesses
it, and before she was aware of her danger, that of
Julia Selwyn was devotedly attached to Mervin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature and education were at war within her.
The consent of her parents would never be given to
her union with him she well knew—and too much
of worldliness still clung to her, to be willing to descend
from her high estate to link her fortunes with
those of her poor, though gifted lover. Yet her
heart shrank from the sacrilege of giving herself to
another. She might for years remain the idol of the
hour, until her beauty began to wane, and in those
years, perhaps Mervin might achieve a degree of
celebrity that must lead to fortune—if not—she could
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
then fulfill the desire of her parents in bestowing
her hand on some wealthy suitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lover destined for her by her parents made his
appearance, and in spite of her mother’s determination
not to reveal his name, Julia at once detected
the anxiety of her parents that Mr. Herbert should
succeed in winning her. He was young, and rather
handsome, with quiet, gentlemanly manners; but
when compared with the young painter he appeared
very commonplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herbert was already in possession of a handsome
estate, and owned a large interest in the firm of
which her father was the principal. He was just
the sort of person Julia felt safe in trifling with. He
had no romance, and was of an extremely indolent
temper—for years he would be content to creep toward
an object he had once proposed to himself to
attain. He was not jealous, and with perfect calmness
saw the girl he contemplated as his future wife,
flirt with the gayest and handsomest men of the city.
He seemed to possess some assurance in his own
mind that she must eventually yield to the fate which
decreed her to become Mrs. Herbert, and until that
time arrived, she might enjoy her liberty as best
suited her inclinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Mervin pursued his career with
astonishing success. The enthusiasm of his soul
was thrown into all he attempted, and urged on by
the overpowering passion of his heart, it was no
wonder that he accomplished well whatever he undertook.
Amateurs declared his talents to be of the
highest order, and brother artists acknowledged his
success, considering his years and opportunities for
cultivation, to be unprecedented. His future greatness
was confidently predicted, and a few of the
patrons of the fine arts met together, and consulted
on a proposal to send him to Europe, that so promising
a genius should possess every facility for
perfecting his style by the study of the old masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A liberal fund was subscribed for that purpose, and
offered with such delicacy that Mervin felt no hesitation
in accepting it as a loan, to be repaid when his
exertions had won the means of so doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His preparations were soon completed, and a farewell
visit to his family made. Then came the first
bitter trial of his life—the parting from Julia Selwyn.
The inexperienced youth, ignorant of the conventional
distinctions of society, had uttered the first
promptings of his heart to the object of his suddenly
awakened passion; but a few weeks sufficed to show
one of his quick perception and nice tact, the wide
gulf that separated the daughter of a reputed millionaire
from the humble child of genius. In words his
passion had never since been expressed, yet Julia
felt that to the last throb of that impetuous heart she
would be the dearest of earthly objects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not leave her thus—she had ever smiled
on him, and from her own lips he must learn his
fate. The years of toil which lay before him,
would, for her sake, be sweet, and his heart trembled
as he contemplated his future if no such bright
hope rose over its distant horizon. If it were denied,
deprived of all motive for exertion, he must
sink at once into insignificance. The pride of genius—the
consciousness of powers which raised him
above the mass of his fellows, was bowed before the
consuming passion that formed the inspiration of his
day dreams, and the theme of his sleeping visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With feelings alternately elevated or depressed, as
hope or fear prevailed in his mind, he repaired to
the mansion of Mr. Selwyn. He found Julia alone,
apparently awaiting the arrival of her party to attend
a ball, for her dress was in the latest style of
elegance. As he entered, she arose from the examination
of a book of engravings, and advanced to meet
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows that I am about to leave my native
land, and yet she could array herself for a ball,”
thought Mervin, and his cheek grew paler than before.
Julia noted the emotion, and frankly extending
her hand said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would come, and though ready to
go to Mrs. Lacy’s party, I feigned a headache, and
staid at home to receive you. I did not know—I
did not hear that you had finally decided to leave,
until we were nearly ready to enter the carriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mervin pressed the hand she extended to him to
his lips and heart in uncontrollable emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, beloved Julia! in this hour I must again
pour into your ear the passion that masters my whole
being. As you shall answer this night, will my fate
for good or evil be decided. How I dare venture to
ask you, the beautiful, the flattered, to wait for
years until a poor artist has achieved independence,
I know not, but the hope is in my heart, Julia, that
you will not deem me presumptuous. Oh, beloved,
the future with its bright promise of fame is cheerless,
without the hope is given that I may attain the
idol of my youth. Speak—let me know my doom!
I go forth sanguine in hope, and certain of success
speedily won—or I carry with me a heart so crushed—so
blighted by the disappointment of its dearest
wish, that the energy to accomplish any thing
worthy of myself will never revive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears were in Julia’s eyes. All her worldliness,
all her hesitation had vanished at the sound of his
words: she was only the loving and beloved woman,
ready to share his lot, whether that lot were gloomy
or bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hope is yours,” she whispered. “Is it not
a brighter destiny to be the artist’s love than the
bride of him whose fortune is his only claim to the
station he holds? The day will come when my
parents will be proud to give me to you. When that
time arrives, take with you the assurance that you
will find me free from other ties, with a heart glorying
in the reputation you have won by your own
exertions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With such a reward in view, what toil will be
too great, what probation too tedious to be borne!
Oh, Julia, you have given me a motive which will
enable me to triumph over every obstacle. But in
the years that must elapse before I can rationally
hope to claim my bride, how will you evade the
persevering pursuit of this Herbert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not fear him, Arthur. He is like a tortoise
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
in pursuit of a bird on the wing, when following me.
I can suffer him to belong to my train for years and
still be no nearer marrying him than now. Besides,
the inexplicable anxiety of my parents to see me
united to him, will prevent them from giving decided
encouragement to the addresses of any other
lover. So you see it is rather on advantage to have
so dilatory a suitor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The influence of your parents will be entirely in
his favor—you will be firm, my beloved—you will
not yield. Remember, if you do, that you will be
answerable for one human destiny. Your confession
of this night has blended your fate, irrevocably with
mine. You cannot draw back without rending the
ties that bind me to reason—perhaps life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have no wish to draw back, Arthur.
Though vain and worldly, there is enough nature
still left in my heart to appreciate and return your
affection. When the last hope of life has departed,
I may yield and become another’s; but while your
love remains as my beacon-light to happiness, I will
continue true to my plighted troth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much further conversation ensued, and just as they
parted, Mervin repeated her own words, “Remember,
love, till the last hope of life has departed, you
are mine, and mine alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia repeated them solemnly, happily, unconscious
in how different a sense from that understood
by the lover, they would be acted on.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'>Two years passed by. The most favorable accounts
were received of the progress of Mervin.
He had passed the greater portion of that time in
Italy, and several beautiful specimens of his rapid
improvement had been transmitted to his friends in
his native land. The lovers contrived to keep up a
correspondence, though the letters were few and far
between, as the greatest caution was observed to
prevent the parents of the fair <span class='it'>fiancée</span> from suspecting
the romantic attachment of their daughter. Julia
well knew that such a discovery would be followed
by a command to trifle no longer with the pretensions
of Mr. Herbert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already they had manifested both impatience and
displeasure at her conduct to that gentleman. He
still continued the same placid and attentive lover;
never elated by the smiles of his mistress, nor depressed
by her frowns; he pursued the “even tenor
of his way,” seemingly assured of final success
where a more mercurial person would have despaired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the crisis in the destiny of the belle approached.
One morning her father entered her room
and requested a few moment’s uninterrupted conversation
with her. Julia sent her young sister
from the apartment and prepared to listen to a remonstrance
in favor of Mr. Herbert’s pretensions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter,” he began, “the time has arrived
when I can no longer postpone the explanation of our
position in regard to Mr. Herbert. You have trifled
with him so long, that I despair of ever seeing you
voluntarily become his wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is there any absolute necessity that I should
unite myself to a man I can never love, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the worse, child. Love, at any rate, is
a mere chimera—an ignis fatuus, that misleads the
young. At all events you must make up your mind
to marry Herbert, or I am a ruined man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can that result be brought about by my
refusal to accept him?” faltered poor Julia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a story, my dear, I would not care to tell
you, if it could be avoided; but I see no hope of influencing
you by other means—so you must e’en
hear it. Sit down, and don’t look so alarmed. You
are pale as death, and trembling like a frightened
dove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia sunk back in her seat, and prepared to listen
with as much calmness as she could command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The father of Herbert and myself commenced life
together, and for many years our united exertions
were eminently successful. He decided to retire
from the firm, when an elegant sufficiency had been
acquired. He had but one child to provide for, and
I made no objection; but as my family was larger, I
thought it incumbent on me to continue my exertions.
The half of Herbert’s gains was withdrawn
from the firm, and invested in real estate secured to
his son. The other moiety continued in my hands.
At his death he bequeathed his claims on me to
George, with a bequest to you of half the funds in
my possession, on the condition that you shall become
the wife of his son; if not, the whole amount
is to be paid to George Herbert on the day he attains
his twenty-fifth year. In two more weeks, if you
do not accept Herbert, I shall be called on to pay a
sum amounting to more than my whole fortune. As
my son-in-law, he pledges himself to allow me to
retain the use of this money until I can advantageously
settle with him, and altogether waives
his claim to the legacy left to you. My affairs are
now in such a state that it will be ruinous to me to
attempt a settlement; so you must even make the
best of it, and give your hand to an honest man who
will render you as happy as the most of your sex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is this the <span class='it'>only</span> alternative?” asked the
pale girl. “Will not Mr. Herbert grant you a
longer time without demanding so great a sacrifice
on my part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truth is, Julia, you have flirted with Herbert
long enough, and he thinks you have not treated
him quite well. If I make such an appeal to him,
his cold temper will be roused, and he will be off
altogether, which would be a misfortune of no common
magnitude; for I must tell you that there is not
the least chance that I shall ever be able to pay a
fraction of this money; and only as the husband of
my daughter can I prevent him from taking such
steps as will ruin me at once. On one hand, it is a
choice of poverty to all you love, and on the other, a
good husband with plenty of money. You are too sensible
to be romantic; and besides, as you have never
yet fallen in love, you have no predilection to plead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At his last words arose the appalling recollection
of her clandestine attachment—and she cast herself
at the feet of her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, my father, and pity me! I have
loved—I do love, with a depth and truth that death
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
alone can destroy. Ask me not to wed this man, for
I am plighted heart and soul to another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom?” was the stern question. “I know
of no one who receives the encouragement of a lover,
save Herbert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One far away—seeking distinction in a foreign
land. Oh, blight not the promise of his young years
by compelling me to falsehood and desertion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! that beggarly painter, Mervin! And is
it for him you have slighted the highest in station—the
brightest in intellect! For two years you have
carried on this deception unsuspected—I have but
one atonement to demand for such duplicity. Accept
Herbert, and it shall be forgotten—refuse, and
you are no longer a child of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vain were the pleadings of the unhappy girl—vain
her appeals to his better feelings. Glad of a pretext
to treat her with such harshness as to drive her into
his measures, Mr. Selwyn availed himself to the
utmost of the one which was offered. She was
literally left no choice between a marriage she detested,
or expulsion from the paternal roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is doubtful whether the parents would have
carried their resentment so far, had she finally refused
compliance with their wishes; but there was
so much at stake, that both father and mother scrupled
not to use every endeavor to urge her into the
proposed union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constitution of Julia had never been robust;
and the conflict in her feelings brought on a severe
attack of illness, from which she very slowly recovered;
and there was a brightness in the large-pupiled
eyes, and a clear spot of rose upon her
cheek, which seemed to speak of early decay and
death. She went out once more, and listened with
apparent acquiescence to the wishes of her parents
in regard to her marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herbert was roused into something like interest,
and his attentions were unremitting. Julia received
them passively—she felt herself a victim to a fate
she had no power to control, and yielded to the will
of those around her. Yet she could not write to
Mervin; she could not tell him who trusted her that
she was about to wed another. No words could
convey to him the wearing persecutions of which
she had been the victim, even could a daughter bring
herself to write such things of her parents. Her
energies were destroyed, and she felt herself borne
forward on the current of events, without the power
to avert the doom they had awarded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the fall advanced, a slight cough alarmed her
mother, and again the physician was summoned.
Julia earnestly desired to see him alone. He found
her in her room with a small parcel on the table before
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor,” she said, with a faint smile, “you are
called on to restore health to the hopeless. You
know that to be an impossible task. I wish you to
tell me honestly and truly, how long you think I can
live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! Miss Julia! you are too young to talk of
dying. Many long and happy years are, I trust, before
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would flatter me with a hope that is not
dear to me. Long life I now ask not—desire not. I
ask you as a man of honor—as a Christian—if you
think it possible for me to recover? To die is now
my only wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the young always say when disappointment
meets them. Your pulse is quick—you are feverish;
but I think these symptoms will pass away. A
winter in a warm climate I shall recommend to Mr.
Herbert as the best thing for you; and I hope to see
you again quite restored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a warm climate? What country will you
recommend?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The South of France—or Italy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Italy! Oh, let it be Italy! I could die contented
there; but I will not consent to go. I dare
not consent to be united to Mr. Herbert unless you
will assure me that the last hope of life is past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor looked at her as if doubting her sanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are young to lie down in the grave with resignation.
There is some mystery here, my young
friend, which is wearing your life gradually away.
Can you not confide in me? I may be able to serve
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only in telling me the truth, and in writing a
few lines for me to one who is far away—not dreaming
of the blow that is about to fall on him. Poor
Arthur! My grief is now more for him than for
myself. You are a friend of Mr. Mervin’s, Doctor.
Write to him, and inform him of my marriage; and
tell him that my last promise was inviolate. I was
his, so long as a hope in life remained. You may
tell him that there was no escape from this loveless
marriage, and the sacrifice of life itself will test the
truth of my affection for him. <span class='it'>Now</span> will you order
me to Italy? that I may die amid the bland airs and
lovely scenes which surround him. The consciousness
that I am in the same land, will gild the remnant
of my waning life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician was deeply touched. He saw that
in her face which spoke to his heart of her rapidly
approaching fate, and his voice faltered as he replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall go to Italy—and I will fulfill your request.
Mervin shall be apprised in the gentlest
manner of all you desire. Would that I could serve
or save you, but the wound lies too deep for my skill
to reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled faintly. “It is a consolation to know
that by the sacrifice of the frail remnant of my existence,
I can secure to my young sister—to my parents,
the enjoyment of a competence at least. Mr. Herbert
has promised me that the wealth bequeathed
to me by his father, on the condition that I became
his bride, shall be secured to my sister, encumbered
with an annuity to my parents. You probably know
that the affairs of my father are inextricably involved,
and this will be their only dependence; but, doctor,
I have made one proviso, to screen my sweet Ellen
from the misery that has been my portion. She is
to enjoy the absolute right of choosing her partner for
life herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These,” she continued, taking the parcel from
the table, “are <span class='it'>his</span> letters. They are few—but very—very
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
precious. Take them—destroy them—I cannot
do it—and I would not have them returned to
him. It would be too bitter to have the memorials
of wasted affection thrown back on the heart from
which they emanated.”</p>

<hr class='tbk122'/>

<p class='pindent'>A few more weeks rolled by, and the sacrifice had
been completed—the victim had been offered up at
the shrine of selfishness and false pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrangements of Herbert were so liberal as to
free Mr. Selwyn from all apprehensions for the
future. He was not avaricious; and in his anxiety
to please the fading bride his money had literally
purchased, he was willing to lavish his fortune with
a profuse hand. He loved Julia as much as his calm
heart was capable of loving any thing; and in the
sunny clime to which they were bound, he confidently
looked forward to her recovery from the effects of
what he called her slight cold. Her parents had never
for an instant allowed him to suspect that, on her
part, there was the least repugnance to the union;
and she had coquetted with him so long, that she
shrank from laying before his cold gaze, the history
of her secret affection for his rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They embarked for Europe, and Julia bade a last
farewell to the land of her birth. As its shores
faded in the distance, she felt the sad conviction that
her eyes had rested on them for the last time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far from renovating her exhausted frame, the
sea-voyage had a contrary effect; and when they
at last entered the bay of Naples, the young bride
was carried on deck to breathe her last sigh in sight
of the land which contained the unconscious Mervin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter of the kind physician had not reached
its destination, and Mervin was still pursuing his
brilliant career with the fond hope of soon being in a
situation to claim his betrothed.</p>

<hr class='tbk123'/>

<p class='pindent'>A solemn procession passed a group of artists collected
together at a corner of one of the principal
streets. The corpse of a young female was borne
past them on a flower-strewn bier, to one of the
principal hotels. A close carriage followed, containing
a single mourner. An inquiry was made as
to who the deceased was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young American lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An undefinable feeling of sympathy with his bereaved
countryman, induced Mervin to separate
from the group, and join the procession. As it
entered the hotel, he was about to follow and offer
his services, when he met a servant belonging to the
establishment to whom he was well known. The
man stopped and addressed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The American signor who has just arrived
wishes an artist to take the likeness of his wife, before
she is buried. As you are a fellow-countryman,
I was about to seek you, signor—for your pictures
are justly renowned, and this lady is even now very
beautiful. The gentleman is too deeply afflicted to
see you himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is his name, Guiseppe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Signor Hibut, or Hobut—I cannot tell which.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of the name, in the Italian’s pronunciation,
appeared so little like the real one, that his
old rival never once occurred to Mervin—and without
further hesitation he dispatched a servant to his
studio to bring the requisite materials for his task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was ushered into the chamber of death; and a
cold thrill of emotion almost unnerved him as he
looked on the bier, with the sharp outline of a human
form clearly defined beneath the white coverlet
that lay above it. The withered flowers which
were strewn over it, seemed but to mock the stern
conqueror who had laid his strong grasp on the marble
form of the dead, and he removed them, though
he withheld his hand from raising the veil which
shrouded her features, until the servant who had
been sent to his studio had fulfilled his commission
and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bright day, and the garish sun streamed
into the room. With the eye of his profession for
effect, he lowered the crimson curtains before the
windows, that their reflection might throw the rosy
hue of life on the pallid features he was to delineate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused as he stood beside the bier, with his
hand upon the linen that shrouded her features.
Some deep emotion appeared struggling in his mind,
and he withdrew his hand. Ashamed of his hesitation,
with a sudden effort he threw back the covering,
and with a cry, sunk upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour passed, and with glazed eyes, and horror-struck
visage, the painter cowered beside the bier,
with his immovable gaze fixed on the still face before
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His wife!” he muttered at intervals; “His
wife!—false—false to me—I that loved her so
madly—trusted her so fondly! His wife—his wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he arose, and seizing his brush, commenced
painting with a rapidity and success that
surprised himself. The picture speedily grew under
his hands into life and beauty; but it did not represent
the dull room with its lifeless inmate. The
starry heavens, and the green vale were faithfully
delineated—a young girl, in the pride of successful
beauty, leaned against an open window—and he
livingly portrayed the peerless loveliness of the embodiment
of his young ideal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before her knelt a youth wearing the features of
the artist himself, but so changed—so full of the anguish
of a broken spirit, that one glance revealed
the history of his slighted love and maddened heart.</p>

<hr class='tbk124'/>

<p class='pindent'>Mervin went forth from that apartment with
faltering steps, and the cold dew of agony upon his
brow. How he reached his home he knew not. He
found a letter on the table—it was the long-delayed
communication of Dr. L——; he retained self-command
enough to read and understand its contents—but
it was the last effort of his over-wrought mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words to his lost love had been prophetic!
The tie that bound him to reason was rent—the
bright promise of his opening years buried in the
grave of his young idol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some kind friend restored him to his native land;
and he now wanders about the home of his father, a
melancholy and harmless wreck.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span>, Arthur, what next!” said a grave-looking
young man of twenty-five, to his friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What next; upon my word I cannot answer that
question at this moment, in fact, I am not quite released
from my last undertaking. One must be off
with the old love before they are on with the new,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appears to me,” said Abram Snow, “that
you had better remain where you are till times improve
a little. I do not make enough to pay my
board, yet it is better to remain than to do worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you are right,” said Arthur; “but I
see no difference between your career and mine as
it respects money affairs, excepting that you have a
thousand dollars at interest, and I have a thousand
dollars in odds and ends. Yes, there is a difference,
Snow, for when business is brisk again you will get
a good salary, for the world considers you as a prudent,
steady fellow, and an excellent book-keeper,
while I shall think myself fortunate in being sent to
the West Indies as supercargo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Hazarelle was led on orphan when quite
young, and his little patrimony was just sufficient to
educate and support him till he was fourteen years
of age. From that time until his twenty-fifth year
he had changed from one occupation to another,
sometimes twice in a year, and it could not be said
that he had a particular talent for any branch of business.
He certainly was ambitious, and he exerted
himself to the utmost for every employer he was
with; but though useful and exemplary in his conduct,
yet some unforeseen event set him adrift. It
was impossible almost to count up the number of
places he filled during the ten years before our little
story commences, the last one was about as promising
as any in which he had been engaged, but in
one week from the time he had this conversation
with Abram Snow, the auctioneer with whom he
was engaged took it into his head to die, and even the
thousand dollars worth of odds and ends died with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Arthur! after paying his week’s board and
his washerwoman he had not more than a dollar in
his pocket, and he was honest enough to tell this to
his landlady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women are tender-hearted, and Mrs. May was as
weak as the rest of her sex; so she pitied Arthur,
and talked over her feelings before one of her boarders,
a surly, ugly old man, who never opened his
lips without finding fault, and who was always
watching Arthur from the corner of his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough for him—better than he deserves,
Mrs. May,” said Mr. Crosbie, “a rolling stone
gathers no moss; why, the wealth of the Indies
would not stick to such a squib—here, there and
every where. To my knowledge he has changed
places twice or thrice a year ever since he was fourteen
years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may all be true, Mr. Crosbie; but from
what I know of him it was none of his fault. I am
quite unhappy about him, for I know very well that
he will not stay one moment in my house unless he
can get money enough to pay his board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crosbie made no answer but—“humph”—and
left the room. He was a man apparently well
advanced in years, ugly in face, and all over out of
joint, he meddled with no man’s business, and in
return, prevented others from interfering with his.
But of all the eyes that were ever set in mortal head
his were the most keen and piercing—he seemed to
read the bottom of your soul at a glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he left the room he met Arthur Hazerelle with
a small traveling trunk in his hand, and on Mrs. May
coming out, he shook hands with her cheerfully, and
wished her a good-morning. He had often felt uneasy
before the searching expression of Mr. Crosbie’s
eye, and it made him actually shudder at this
moment. He seemed to have lost the power of
will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way are you bound?” said the old gentleman,
fixing his eye still more firmly on Arthur’s
face. “If you are going to Berrydale, back of the
granite hills, here is a letter for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur stared at him not only with astonishment
but dismay, for he had but the moment before decided
on going there, and had not communicated his
intention to any one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are going, say so,” growled out the man,
“for the cars start at nine, and you have no time to
lose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur mechanically took the letter, put it in his
pocket, and raising his hat, walked out of the house,
feeling certain that Mr. Crosbie was staring at him
from the street door, Mrs. May from the green
blinds in the parlor, and the servants from the basement
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his way he stopped to say good-bye to Abram
Snow, who was hard at work at his desk. He was
not at all surprised at the flitting, but there was one
excellent trait in his character, he never intruded
his advice upon any one. He wrote down his
friend’s address—Berrydale—and thrusting a cigar in
Arthur’s hand, they parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>cars</span>,” thought Arthur, “no cars for me, I
must walk the whole distance, for a dollar will not
pay the fare even.” So he stepped lightly along, no
way discouraged, for he never yet had left a place—or
rather, a place had never left him without his
having the prospect of another. He had not gone
more than two miles before he was overtaken by a
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
singular looking man, dressed in a brown linen
frock-coat and pantaloons, with a brown cap, a
brown umbrella and a brown carpet-bag. He wore
spectacles, had a remarkably long nose and chin,
and when he came up with Arthur begged him not
to walk so fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur turned hastily to see who had accosted
him so unceremoniously, and the man smiled. It
was a pleasant smile certainly, but it did not accord
with the peculiar style of his face, at any rate Arthur
took no notice of him, and walked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did not you put your trunk in the cars?”
said the man, “you would walk much more to your
satisfaction if you were not so weighed down—here,
give me one end of it, and let us trudge on together;
my carpet-bag is not heavy enough to incommode
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So saying, he caught up one end of Arthur’s trunk
and on they went together; the stranger whistling
carelessly, and the young man very much surprised,
and somewhat amused at the oddness of the stranger’s
manner and appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very kind in you,” said Arthur, laughing
out loud, “but my little trunk is not heavy, as you
perceive; I dare say your carpet-bag is of twice the
weight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four times,” said the man, “but I am more used
to carry heavy parcels than you are. How far are
you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur told him, and then they fell into the common
chat of strangers, and thus they proceeded till
two o’clock, when both, weary enough, entered a
small tavern to rest and take a luncheon. They had
exchanged names on the road, and Arthur found that
his new acquaintance was called Galton Springle,
and that he was a schoolmaster on his way to a
small school now vacant near Drizzletown. As this
place lay in Arthur’s route, and the man was not
offensive in his manners, our young friend was quite
willing that they should proceed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ham and eggs and an apple-pie made up their
dinner, and as this was soon provided and soon dispatched,
they still lingered on the sofa, or wooden
settle rather, when Galton Springle proposed smoking.
He had about a dozen cigars, in a box at the
bottom of his bag, and offered one to Arthur, who
refused, recollecting that his friend, Abram Snow,
had given him one at parting—he took it from his
pocket, but what was his surprise on opening the
little roll of stiff brown paper, to find instead of a
cigar, a roleau of ten cent pieces!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Galton Springle looked at the opening of this little
paper from the corner of his eye and smiled to himself,
for he saw that the contents were unknown to
the young man. He made no observation, however,
but calling for a candle, lighted his cigar and began
to smoke. As he made no further offer of one to
Arthur, the latter pocketed his roleau and leaned
back against the wall, thinking over the past and
hoping brightly for the future. There could not be
more than three dollars, he thought, in the roll, but
even this sum was a great deal for Snow to give,
and it was so delicately given that Arthur felt truly
grateful and promised thousands in return. When
the cigar was finished and the reckoning paid, they
proceeded on their journey till evening, when they
rested again, but this time it was on a bench near
the tavern door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we rest awhile,” said Springle, “we shall be
fresh enough to reach Drizzletown by ten o’clock,
and you can then share my room, or have one to
yourself if you like. There is a very decent tavern
there and the charges are very moderate, so let us
remain together for the night, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In half an hour they took up their baggage and
went on, though poor Arthur began to flag, for he
was unaccustomed to such severe exercise, whereas
Springle seemed as light of foot as when they first
met. By ten, however, they reached Drizzletown,
and as the moon was at the full, Arthur saw a few
scattered houses, without any attempt at regularity
as it respected their position, and no appearance of
a street at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur saw that Springle was as much a stranger
to the host of the little inn as he was himself, so he
presumed that this was his first visit to the place,
and yet the man knew the road so well, and spoke
of the people residing there in so particular a manner,
that he could not suppose this was his first
visit. A bowl of bread and milk constituted their
supper, and as Arthur preferred a room to himself,
they were shown to separate chambers and retired
for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man slept soundly till eight o’clock,
and when called to breakfast saw that he was alone.
He was told that his companion had left the house
at daylight, leaving his carpet-bag and a letter. The
tavern-keeper said that in lounging about the door
he had seen an acquaintance and had gone off with
him. After breakfast the letter was brought, and to
his surprise it was directed to himself, it ran thus—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“An unforeseen circumstance has occurred which
obliges me to return to the city whence I came,
and as I have plenty of clothing there, I make you a
present of the carpet-bag and its contents. Do not
part with the bag, however, let your necessities be
ever so great, as I value it very highly, though I
part with it to you. When you are settled to your
liking leave your address in this house, and the man,
Mr. Somers, will forward it to me.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:7em;'>Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'><span class='sc'>Galton Springle</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know this man, this Galton Springle?”
said Arthur to the landlord. “He is a stranger to
me, and yet he makes me a present of this bag and
all that it contains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlord did not know him, had never seen
him before, and thought him the ugliest hound that
ever lived—evidently envious of Arthur’s good luck,
and tormenting himself with the probability of his
possessing the bag himself had he known that the
owner was not to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was still ten miles to walk before Arthur
could reach Berrydale, and what was worse, the
road wound round a mountain, so that there was an
ascent of three miles before he could reach the
railroad that ran through the village to which he was
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
going. Being now encumbered with more baggage,
and having money enough to indulge himself, he
hired a wagon to take him to Berrydale, where he
arrived just as the dinner was smoking on the table
of a small inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Green, the landlord, knew Arthur, and of
course gave him a landlord’s welcome. In a few
minutes, after washing the dust from his face and
hands, he was seated at the table with his host and
family, and two strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what brought you here Mr. Hazerelle?”
said the landlord, good-humoredly, “I hope whatever
it is, you are to stay some time with us—I presume
you are on a shooting frolic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My stay depends upon yourself and your neighbors,
Mr. Green. I see by the papers that you are in
want of a teacher, and feeling myself competent, I
intend to offer myself as a candidate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlord looked at him with astonishment.—“What!
you, you a country schoolmaster! why
times have fallen heavily upon you I fear!—But
really, if you are disposed to teach, I will answer
for it you shall have the preference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he said this, his eye lighted on one of his
guests, and there was such an expression of malignity
in the man’s face, that he started. This man
had only arrived a few minutes before Arthur. He
came, with two heavy, uncouth looking trunks, and
two ugly looking dogs; ordered a bed-room for himself,
a kennel for his dogs, and then took his seat at
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I intend to offer myself as candidate too,” said
this man to Arthur, “so we start fair, young man; I
will set my acquirements and recommendations
against yours, and then wait the issue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it depend upon letters of recommendation,”
said Arthur, “you will surely succeed, for I did not
bring one, and I am but slightly known to my good
friend here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlord turned round and winked slyly at
his wife, for the idea of such a gnarled, old hickory
knot, as this man, with his spiteful eye and face,
pretending to compete with Arthur was too ridiculous.
Mr. Green was a landholder, and a justice
of the peace, he was in high request as a politician,
had money at interest, and had four children to educate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When dinner was over, the stranger whose name
was Godfried Darg, drew near to Arthur, and in a
sort of snuffling voice, breathing hard through the
nose between his sentences, he “begged to box the
compass with him.” Arthur smiled, and said “he
had no objection; he might be questioned on any
subject which came within the reach of the advertisement,
and perhaps something further.” So the
rough man began to spout Latin. Arthur acquitted
himself very well, and to the satisfaction of the
other stranger, who had taken dinner with them,
and who now drew near also, to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are very few persons who would have indulged
this queer-looking old fellow in this whim,
but as we observed, Arthur was good-natured, and
being indifferent about the issue, he let the man
draw out the little learning he possessed. Mr. Conway,
the other stranger had been in France, and
understood the language well, and in a short time
he found that Arthur left his antagonist far behind
in that language. Darg said nothing at the
end of the French trial, but proceeded at once to the
German, he was foiled here too, and so they went
on from one branch to another, Mr. Conway deciding
in his own mind that the young man was an excellent
scholar, and would suit his own purpose
exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Godfried Darg having ‘boxed the compass’ without
tripping up his rival, now descended to the minor
points.—“Can you mend pens as quickly as I can?”
said he, cutting up and making half-a-dozen pens in
a shorter time than ever pens were made before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you beat me over and over,” said Arthur,
“for I never made a decent pen in my life, I use
steel pens, or rather a gold pen altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you teach the children to dance?” said
Darg:—“Here,” said he, getting up, and cutting
two or three of the old fashioned pigeon wings,—“can
you do this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur and all present laughed heartily, and the
young man acknowledged that he had the advantage
there too, “for he did not teach dancing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him take the situation,” said Conway, as the
old man left the room to feed his dogs, “I am looking
out for a teacher, and you are just the one to
suit me. Here you will only get one hundred and
fifty dollars a year, and very plain board; whereas,
with me you shall have three hundred, and live
upon the fat of the land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, this offer was better than the one Arthur
came to seek; and he told Mr. Conway that he
should talk the matter over with Mr. Green, and
then give him an answer. But Mr. Green shook his
head; he had no great opinion of Conway, who was
the principal of the grammar-school in Drizzletown,
and had about forty boys under his care. They
knew little of him, and for his part, he said, he did
not care to know more. He advised Arthur to rough
it with them until something better offered, and promised
to give him board for a very moderate sum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This decided Arthur—for he longed for rest and
ease of mind; and if he remained here, he should be
with a man who felt a friendly interest in his welfare.
The next morning at ten o’clock the trustees
of the school were to meet—and there were already
nine candidates even for so humble a situation. The
good-hearted landlord told Arthur not to be cast
down, for, according to his judgment, the trustees
would decide in his favor unanimously. His only
wonder was, that such an ill-looking fellow as Darg,
though he might have a pocket-full of letters, should
presume to expect an acceptance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One by one the candidates were examined, and one
by one they departed. Godfried Darg requested to be
questioned last—and Arthur’s turn now came. He
could not help smiling as he saw the solemn
pomposity of the committee, not one of whom were
judges of the real merits of a candidate—and he felt
that before them he had no chance. All at once he
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
recollected the letter given to him by Mr. Crosbie;
and stepping up to the gentleman at the head of the
table, whose name he learned was Barnes, asked if
that letter were for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Barnes took the letter, nodded his head gravely,
and opened it—he read it—passed it to his neighbor,
who in his turn read it—and so it went around the
table. When they had all finished it, Mr. Barnes
said, “I believe, gentlemen, I can anticipate your
sentiments—and so, with your leave, I shall beg Mr.
Hazerelle to retire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is there in that letter,” said Arthur, to Mr.
Barnes, “which refuses me a hearing? I came here
by the invitation of your advertisement; and as to
the letter which has given you, as I perceive, an unfavorable
opinion of me, the writer of it has no more
knowledge of me than I have of any gentleman here
present—not so much, in fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not bound to answer questions, young
gentleman,” said Mr. Barnes; “we are sorry if you
are disappointed, but you must leave us just now, as
there is another person to examine, and our time is
short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur could not help laughing, in spite of his
chagrin; and yet his fingers tingled with a desire to
box the speaker’s ears. He made his bow, however,
and told his kind friend, Mr. Green, how cavalierly
he had been used. Mr. Green was too much
surprised to make a remark; and his wife observed,
with much anger, that old Crosbie ought to be tarred
and feathered, for taking away the character of an innocent
man. Arthur told them that he must get sight
of the letter, for until he knew what had been
alledged against him, he could not defend himself.
And while they were yet speaking, Godfried Darg
entered with his dogs, to say that he had been found
worthy, and should enter on his duties the beginning
of the week. He nodded impudently to Arthur, and
observed as he went to the kennels, that it was a
pity the young gentleman had not been accepted, as
he had too much learning to be allowed to starve
for the want of employment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha Green, the landlord’s daughter, whispered
something in her father’s ear, and he shook his head.
She spoke to her mother, who listened with more
complacency, for she beckoned her husband out of the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall just say a few words to you, Mr. Hazerelle,”
said the landlord, as he returned, “and they
are this: there is your room, and here is your table;
and in my house you remain until you can get some
employment. I did hope that what I said to those
ninnies yonder would have been sufficient to satisfy
them; as it is, however, they can employ this rough
old fellow if they choose, but they shall have no child
of mine—and that will worry them a little. After
dinner, I shall propose something to you which I
hope will suit you better than to torment yourself
with young children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner Godfried Darg conducted himself quietly
and respectfully—the very reverse of his conduct before
he was chosen schoolmaster, at which the little
party were surprised—for they expected he would
be a perfect nuisance. He ate in silence, and as
soon as he finished, got up, took the bones from his
own, and, in fact, from all the plates at table, and
went to the kennel to feed his dogs—Howler and
Barker, as he called them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, come here, Mr. Hazerelle,” said the landlord;
“let us sit on this bench, and enjoy our cigar,
while I tell you of a plan suggested by my daughter,
Martha. Over yonder,” pointing to a forest about
a mile distant, “hidden from our sight though, is a
fine old stone building, and in that old stone building—a
perfect castle it is—lives a fine old woman, proud
as Lucifer though, who has a fine young girl under
her care. This lady has a son, as proud as herself,
who has continued single to this day—being well-nigh
to fifty years of age—because he could not find
any one good and high enough for him. There the
family has lived for thirty years. We cannot make
Mr. Herman out exactly, for he never comes frankly
and cheerily amongst us; so we have to guess a
great deal—and perhaps we sometimes guess wrong.
At any rate, some people say that he wants to marry
his mother’s beautiful ward; and some say she is
his daughter—and so we go on and know nothing
certain, but that there they are, and there they will
remain till they die. Sometimes we see Mr. Herman”—Arthur
started—“every day for weeks together,
and then he is absent for one, two, and three
months at a time. Madam Herman, as the folks
call her, has never been seen on this side of that
forest; but that pretty creature, Grace Gordon, comes
to our village-church, and sometimes rides about the
country on horseback with Mr. Herman, or an old
groom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of a looking man is this Mr. Herman?”
said Arthur. “I once knew a gentleman of that
name, and he interested me exceedingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! he could not have been our Mr. Herman,
for he is not an interesting man at all. His personal
appearance is well enough, but the expression of his
face is unpleasing; and he is so wrapt up in his own
conceit, that he scorns to talk. I don’t think he
ever asked me a question in his life, not even such
questions as people ask out of pure good-fellowship—as
what do you think of the weather, or how will
the crops turn out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be the one I know,” said Arthur, “for
he was quite a talker, and interested himself in
every thing that was going on—but let me not interrupt
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this young lady, Miss Grace, wants to
learn the German language; and they have advertised
far and near for a teacher, one who would give
two lessons a day, an hour each time, for six months.
Now my daughter hinted, that as you were disappointed
about the school, you might be more fortunate
if you applied to Madam Herman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly should have no objection,” said
Arthur; “but I fear that they would require better
references than I could give. You see that even my
superiority over Mr. Darg was of no use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you forget the letter; it was <span class='it'>that</span> which decided
your fate—we must get hold of it somehow.
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
But what I was going to observe is this, you can
write a note to Mr. Herman, and offer yourself as a
teacher of the German. You can but try—faint
heart, the proverb says, never won fair lady; and
Grace Gordon is worth the winning. You see, my
young friend, that we have sprung over the fence to
get sight of a wedding before you have seen the
bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the kind-hearted innkeeper and his family
talked the little plot over, and dropped a few words
of assurance now and then to Arthur, and when bedtime
came he had made up his mind that he would
make the attempt, giving such references as were in
his power. He had been twice to Berrydale on shooting
excursions, and quite won the hearts of Mr.
Green’s family, the boys in particular, two of
whom accompanied him each time—they were his
sworn friends, and were loud in their praises of his
good-nature in breaking off his sport to teach them
some of the mysteries of the art. Mrs. Green knew
Mrs. May, the lady with whom Arthur had boarded
for several years, and of course she was well acquainted
with every particular of the young man’s
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he has chopped and changed about in out-door
business,” said Mrs. May, “he has been constant to
me, and when he is not to be found at my house it
is because there is not money enough in his purse
to pay his board. How he lives till I see him
again, I cannot tell, but I ask no questions, and he
asks no favors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur looked around his peaceful, quiet little
room, and at the gentle, harmonious prospect spread
before his window, and thought how pleasant it
would be to live there forever. He was weary of
change—no fault of his, poor fellow—and thought
that no office would be beneath him, if there was a
possibility of securing a humble retreat like this.
And yet Arthur was ambitious in the true sense of
the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they sat down to breakfast Mr. Darg was
not there, the hostler said he whistled to his dogs at
break of day, and walked off with them toward the
brook. The horn was sounded and search made,
but he came not, and they finished their breakfast
without him. Mrs. Green told the girl to keep the
coffee hot as he would no doubt soon come in from
his ramble, and she went up stairs to attend to her
duties. In a few minutes she returned, with a letter
directed to Arthur, it had been found under the old
man’s pillow, and she stood by while Arthur
read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said he, “this is as singular an adventure
as the one at Drizzletown,” and he read out as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I am heartily tired of keeping school
already, though I have not yet begun, and so vacate
in your favor. If any of your pupils turn out clever
fellows, tell them how much cleverer they would
have been if I had been their master. I consulted
my dogs this morning at break of day, and I am
pretty sure they thought the confinement of a kennel
quite as irksome and unwholesome as I should
teaching thick-headed boys in a forlorn, comfortless
school-house. When you go to the city during vacation,
you can hear of my whereabouts of Mrs.
May, for an old fellow living there, by the name of
Crosbie, knows all my concerns. Meantime I ask
your acceptance of my shaving-apparatus, it is rather
too good for you, but as I heard you ask the innkeeper
for a razor, I concluded the present would
be acceptable. If you ever get a chance I wish you
would spit in the face of that solemn ass Barnes, and
call Mr. Herman a fool, for me, will you?</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Yours till death,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'><span class='sc'>Godfried Darg</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>They laughed very heartily at this strange epistle,
and one of the boys rushed up stairs for the shaving-box.
It was indeed a beautiful affair, and all the
articles were of the very finest quality; but what
created great surprise was the contents of a note
found on the top of a little steel-box which fitted
nicely in one of the divisions. The note ran thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Within the little steel-box is the miniature of the
lady you are destined to marry, this box you are not
to open till you see my two dogs, Howler and
Barker, and then by consulting them you will find
out the way to open the box, for it has a curious
fastening, and cannot be opened but by their connivance
unless it is broken, and if broken, the miniature
will be destroyed. I think you can depend on
yourself in this particular, but be sure to spit in
Barnes’ face, and if you could add a tweak of the
nose and a kick, you would greatly oblige me.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>G. D.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of course it was agreed on all sides that the little
box should remain quietly untouched just where it
now lay, but they made themselves very merry over
the letter and note. As to applying again for the
school not one of the family would listen to it, not
even if Mr. Barnes came in person to make the
offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said Davie, the youngest boy; “not if he
were to fall down on his knees and beg you to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This created a laugh again, and this good-heartedness
was very soothing to poor Arthur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not one of the children would take the letter to
Herman Hall, and the hostler was too shabby a looking
fellow to be sent on such an errand to so grand
a place, so Martha’s lover, Garry Lovel, a young
man who worked Mr. Green’s farm <span class='it'>on shares</span>, undertook
to deliver it himself. There need not have
been such confabulations on the subject, for Garry
did not get farther than the porter’s lodge, an awful
gloomy looking place, Garry said, and the porter
was as awful-looking and gloomy as the lodge. He
was told that an answer would be sent in the course
of the day, and he therefore need not wait, and the
young man said he put wings to his feet and a quarter
of a mile between him and the porter before he got
to an ordinary walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were you, Mister Arthur,” said Garry, “I
never would set foot in yon hall, for there is something
wrong there. I can’t believe that honest people
would shut themselves up in that dull, musty sort of
way, unless they had something to conceal. You
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
had far better turn farmer, here is a fine chance, for
neighbor Fielding wants to go West, and he would
rent his farm for a trifle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do take it,” said Mrs. Green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martha, blushing; “let him take
father’s farm on shares, that will be easier, for I
want Garry to take the next farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a merry shout of laughter, and
the boys declared she was right, and that Arthur
should stay with them, and they would plough and
reap for him while he tinkered about, shot birds, and
caught fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward evening the answer to his letter came, he
was requested to call at Herman Hall at ten o’clock
the next day, and then he might decide whether the
terms would suit him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At ten o’clock he was at the porter’s lodge, where
the solemn-looking personage who had so awed
Garry stood ready to receive him. A low, garden-chaise,
with a pair of handsome ponies, was waiting
for him, into which he seated himself. The ride
was enchantment. No fairy dream could have conjured
up the beautiful scenery which opened to his
view at every turn of the road. Arthur was lost in
rapture, he forgot his humble circumstances and his
slender fortunes, for his whole soul was filled with
lofty thoughts, he seemed elevated to the companionship
of angels, and he gloried that he was a man
after God’s own image. “Angels,” thought he,
as the carriage moved slowly along, “could not feel
happier, nor have purer emotions than I enjoy this
moment. I have had the fear of God before me and
have reverenced Him always, but here I love Him—<span class='it'>these</span>
are His glorious works. Cities are made by
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur had lived in cities always, and his little
excursions, hastily made, and very limited in duration,
were for the purpose of fishing or shooting, and
always with a dull companion, like Snow, who
fished and shot in the same way that he kept books—pursuing
the one act, the one thought which he proposed
doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herman Hall had been in the possession of the
family for more than a century; it was originally
selected on account of its beauty and fine prospects,
and art had assisted nature in embellishing it. Arthur
entered the mansion-house a far different man
than he was an hour before. A new sense—a new
feeling had been given to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His name was announced by the footman, and the
man who received it passed it to another, who
opened a parlor door, and then came forward to
request him to walk in. With his mind filled with
such a blaze of glory as that through which he had
passed, the petty formalities of a common man,
better in external gifts than himself, seemed as
nothing, so that when Mr. Herman waved his hand
to a chair, Arthur seated himself with as much ease
as if he had been worth a million.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is your letter I presume,” said Mr. Herman.
Arthur bowed. “You are competent to teach
the German language”—another bow,—“and what
are your terms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur smiled, for the truth is he never thought
of terms, he concluded there was a set price, and
that there would be no difficulty on that score.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall name your own terms, sir,” said he,
“I have never taught, but I understand the method
of teaching, and therefore leave the minor consideration
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall say a dollar an hour, if that sum suits
you,” said Mr. Herman, and Arthur was quite satisfied.
He was to begin in the course of an hour,
and until the young lady was ready, he was requested
to walk in the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A library! A private library! Arthur had seen
several of them, and had been in the city, and in
circulating libraries, but he never, even in works of
history and fiction had read of any to equal the extent
and magnificence of this one. This library
occupied the whole ground floor of a wing of what
might be called a castle, and no book was beyond
the reach of the hand. The roof or ceiling was supported
by forty columns, the base of each being ten
feet square, five feet high, and filled with books.
There was just space enough between each column
for a person to pass with ease, and there were
lounges and chairs scattered about in every direction.
This curious library contained all that was
valuable and rare, and not an author of note was
omitted. One column was devoted to Shakspeare
alone, with every commentator from the earlier to
the present time, and here, as if by instinct, Arthur
seated himself. He was soon buried in the charms
of the author’s fancy, and when the servant announced
that the ladies requested to see him, he had
some difficulty to bring his thoughts down to a level
with a dollar an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After walking through an interminable suite of
apartments—all to impress him with the wealth and
consequence of the owners, he was ushered into a
small room, such as ladies are fond of calling a
<span class='it'>boudoir</span>, here sat two ladies, the younger of whom
rose as he entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray be seated,” said Madam Herman, waving
her hand in the same gracious manner as her son,—“Sit
here, and let me request you to listen to certain
preliminaries before you begin your duties.—If
you dislike them, we can part at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let the preliminaries suit yourself!” said
Arthur, “and I shall make no objection, provided
I may spend one hour a day, or even less, in
that glorious library, why, madam, I shall never
dream of remuneration, there is food and raiment,
and every thing that can delight the soul, at the foot
of one column alone—the one devoted to Shakspeare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Herman stared at him with perfect amazement.
He heard a clear ringing laugh as if in the
next room, and on glancing his eye toward the
window, there sat the young lady, brimful of smiles
and blushes, with her head bending over a piece of
embroidery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man came down from his stilts at
once. Shakspeare—the library—the glorious scenery—all
vanished, and there he sat a humble
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
teacher of the German language, for one dollar an
hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The preliminaries, young man,” said the old
lady, stiffly, not regarding his rhapsody, or subsequent
embarrassment—“are few, but must be complied
with strictly.—Hear them out without interruption,
and then decide for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At ten o’clock precisely you are to be in this
room, there is your seat, and there is the lady who
is to receive instruction.” Arthur rose, and bowed
to this lady, who half rose and blushed exceedingly.
“I shall remain in the room, and give notice when
the hour expires. There is to be no conversation
excepting what relates to the language you are
teaching, and when the hour is expired you can go
to the library, or ride out, or amuse yourself on the
grounds, till the servant announces to you that it is
time to dress for dinner. You are to dine with us.”
Arthur did not like this part of the arrangement,
and sat uneasily in his chair.—“Go to your room as
soon as the dessert is removed, and be your own
master till five o’clock, when another hour of your
time will be required; I shall be in the room as before,
and give you notice when the hour is up, and
the family then sees you no more till ten the next
day, excepting that this lady will preside at the
breakfast and tea table. You are to remain with us
until the lady is sufficiently grounded in the language
to proceed in it by herself, and you are neither to
leave the place, nor see any one till that time arrives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same clear laugh was heard in the next
room, and with a glance of his eye, he saw that the
young lady held a handkerchief to her face.—Arthur
rose;—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no idea madam that I was to be the happy
inmate of this paradise, but as it is your pleasure, I
agree to the terms excepting, that once a week I
must have the privilege of seeing one or two of my
humble Berrydale friends. The porter’s lodge can
be our place of rendezvous, and all that they shall
ever hear from my lips is, that I am happy beyond
my hopes. I think it is the desire to remain unknown
to the people in the neighbourhood, which
gives rise to your request that I hold no communication
with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Herman made no reply—she pointed to the
table where books, paper, and pens lay, and began
to knit with dignified solemnity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took his seat opposite to the young lady,
(whose name had not been mentioned by Mrs. Herman,)
but drew his chair so that his face was partly
hidden, for he wanted to catch glimpses of his pupil’s
face, unseen by Mrs. Herman. He took up the
books, examined them, and selecting one, began to
read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The language must appear harsh to you,” said
he, “but as soon as you have acquired the pronunciation,
you will like it exceedingly.—I was acquainted
with a gentleman who had a great desire”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No anecdotes, if you please, Mr. Hazerelle,”
said Mrs. Herman,—“Please to recollect.” Arthur
really was “struck all in a heap,” particularly as he
again heard the laugh in the next room. The young
lady pitied his confusion, but the laugh was irresistible,
and she joined in it. What could Arthur do
better than to laugh also? Instead of ordering him
to leave the house as he expected, the old lady
begged them to proceed, as “minutes made up
hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got through the first lesson without further remark,
though the young lady could scarcely keep
her countenance, and when the hour had expired,
Mrs. Herman rang a little table bell, and the servant
who came in was requested to show Mr. Hazarelle
his chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Arthur had shut his room door, he
threw himself on the sofa and laughed heartily, but
what was his amazement when he heard the same
clear ringing laugh as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word,” thought he, “this is a queer
place. All solemn nonsense on one side—all puerile
formality on the other—and harlequinism in the
centre.—Truly, I am curiously hemmed in, and can
scarcely hope to steer clear among such an odd set.—Who
can that merry laugher be?—I certainly
have heard that clear bell voice before!—Where
can I have heard it?”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the more he thought,” as the children say,
“the more he could not tell;” so he looked round
his chamber, and there, to his surprise, was his
trunk, his carpet-bag, and his dressing-case. Really
this is taking things for granted, thought he; why
these articles must have been sent for the moment I
entered the house; they thought I should be a fool
to refuse compliance with their terms, which, in
fact, they might safely infer had I hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now our readers must not suppose that Arthur
was a sorry fellow, and willing to put up with insult.
On the contrary, he was high-minded and brave, and
from an equal would receive no provocation. But
he was forbearing to the weak and nervous; and in
the present case, it would be absurd to resent either
the folly of Mrs. Herman, or the impertinence of the
laugher, even could he find him out. Besides, there
was an air of mystery and enchantment around the
people and place, which was very captivating to a
young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hours slipt away at the column of Shakspeare,
and a servant informed him that it was time
to dress for dinner, which business did not take him
many minutes to accomplish, as he was one of those
rare persons whose dress is never out of order.
“Dust never sticks to him,” as homely Mrs. May
used to tell her friends—a saying which Mrs. Green
was fond of repeating to <span class='it'>her</span> friends whenever his
name was mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now for an extraordinary scene, thought Arthur,
as the servant bowed him down to the dining-room.
I shall see a magnificent service of plate and a royal
dinner. But he was disappointed in one respect—for
though the dinner-service was splendid, yet the
dinner itself was simple beyond all imagination.
The table was set for four persons, Mrs. Herman was
at the head, her son at the foot, and Arthur and
Grace Gordon opposite to each other. Fricasseed
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
chickens and boiled ham constituted the meat part of
the dinner; but there was a number of dishes of delicate
vegetables, delicately cooked, and a variety of
fine fruit for dessert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was neither wine nor ale, but pitchers of
ice-water in abundance—and all seemed to eat with
an appetite. Madam Herman helped liberally, but
talked sparingly. Mr. Herman uttered not a syllable,
Grace Gordon was in high spirits, and laughingly
asked a few questions in German, such as she
had learned in the morning, Arthur answered her
gravely, according to contract—and thus the first
dinner passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the library was a great novelty, Arthur betook
himself to the Shakspeare column again, and there
he remained until five o’clock, when he was summoned
to the study. He found Madam Herman
seated in her rocking-chair, and Grace Gordon at the
table, with a smile on her face of dubious meaning,
and her handkerchief more than once raised to
hide it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the lesson was a dry matter-of-fact business, he
was fully rewarded by the quickness of the young
lady’s apprehension; she perfectly comprehended
what Arthur had taught her in the morning, and he
feared her progress would be so rapid, that he should
not remain in this enchanted castle very long. He
turned round to Madam Herman, when she rung the
little bell for the servant to bow him out, and observed
that Miss Gordon had made great progress
already. The old lady made no reply, but drew up
with quiet dignity, and there was scorn on her features.
Miss Gordon blushed and held down her
head, pitying the young man’s embarrassment, and
again, from the half-open door the same clear laugh
was heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur stood for a moment irresolute, he had half
a mind to quit the house at once; for the disagreeable
manners of the old lady, the cold formality of
her son, and the laugh, which seemed as if in
mockery, were more than a counterpoise to the
great benefits and pleasures of his situation. But the
young lady was unexceptionable in her manners;
she was not, to be sure, familiar, or even social, as is
always the case between teacher and scholar; but
there was nothing offensive—and it was a pleasure
to look at her beautiful face. He stood irresolute,
however, and probably would have made his parting
bow, had not his eye glanced at the following words,
evidently written that moment—<span class='it'>never take offense
where none is meant</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A grateful bow and a deep blush convinced the
young lady that she should not lose her teacher.
Arthur was bowed out of the room as before, and
jumping in the chaise which the servant said was
waiting for him, he rode down to the lodge to see
his friends, who were to meet him there at six o’clock.
The four boys, Mr. Green, and Garry, were all clustering
in the room waiting for him, and his heart
warmed with joy on receiving their honest, hearty
greeting. Garry asked if he might tell Mrs. Green
and Martha to come the next day—and the boys declared
that they would be there also. There was a
delicacy about these unsophisticated people which
prevented them from asking questions, as soon as
they heard the terms of his contract at Herman Hall.
Arthur told them, however, that he was quite happy,
and that his pupil would not want his assistance more
than a month, as she learned very quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servant presented himself at the door, and
Arthur found it was time to bid his honest friends
adieu, promising to see them once a week at that
hour—and so they reluctantly parted. On his return
to the house, he was shown to a small room adjoining
the library, and on the table was the tea equipage.
The man asked if he would like to go to his chamber
before taking tea; and Arthur, supposing this part of
the etiquette, followed him up stairs, where, as
usual, the door was opened for him, and, with a low
bow, the servant retired. After arranging his hair and
dress, he sat at the casement enjoying the beautiful
prospect, and regretting that it would, like a dream,
so soon fade away—for he was quite certain that the
lady would master the most difficult part of the language
in less than six weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How strangely are we constituted, and how little
do we know of what the mind is capable. In a few
hours Arthur was a changed man. The petty anxieties
of a business life, all originating in the necessity
of providing for daily wants, were cast aside,
never to be resumed again—for new feelings, new
hopes filled his whole soul. He never before understood
the greatness, the goodness of God; he never
comprehended His power over creation, and that all
things, all that was beautiful, was the work of His
hand. It was in this magnificent solitude that his
heart opened to all this glory; and it seemed as if a
film had fallen from his sight. Men <span class='it'>cannot know
God in cities</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>New faculties have been given to me, thought he,
on descending to the tea-room. I am in communion
with a holy and chaste spirit, which will, I know,
sustain me; and the future, so dreaded, I now look
forward to with a certainty of success. My heart is
made up of love and charity—and every human being
shall have a claim upon my tenderness. Even the
weak and infirm of purpose I shall endeavor to comfort
and advise; and as to this beautiful girl, so far,
so infinitely my superior—why may I not love her
as a dear sister, love her in secret and—</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was by this time in the room, and there, at the
head of the table, sat the beautiful girl, who had just
passed through his mind in such near relationship.
Wholly unprepared for her presence—for he had forgotten
that she was to preside at the breakfast and
tea-table—he started back in the fear that the servant
had made a mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Gordon half rose, smiled, and bid him take
a seat. Instead of the silence and reserve of the
dinner-table, Arthur found himself in animated conversation,
and he was pouring out his feelings, when
he heard the same clear, loud laugh as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Relieved from restraint, for the absence of Madam
Herman left him at liberty, he arose as if to see
who it was that had thrown an air of ridicule on his
conversation. Grace Gordon put her finger to her
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
lip and pointed to his chair, and this, at once, subdued
the anger which was fast rising, and determined
him to wait for a more suitable opportunity
to gratify his curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are good-tempered I hear, Mr. Hazerelle,
and good-temper is a gift which few possess. Perhaps,
however, you have not been severely tested.
Many people pass for good-tempered who are irritable
and irascible when thwarted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It depends altogether upon the person who provokes
me,” said Arthur. “A woman, for instance,
is always sure of forbearance, be she ever so disposed
to find fault, and a man walks untouched,
though he might insult me, if I consider him as an
inferior. So, you perceive, I am good-tempered
with a qualification, and it depends upon the character
of our friend in ambush whether I am to take
offense at that clear, ringing laugh. If he is in any
way connected with you, he may indulge his risible
propensities to the utmost, for I am certain that I can
submit to such gaucheries for the very short time I
am to be honored by your kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Short time, Mr. Hazerelle! Well, if you call a
twelvemonth short, be it so,” said she. “Why, did
you suppose I could thoroughly understand the German
language in less time than that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In less than a twelvemonth! Yes, in less than
three months you will be able to speak and read
fluently; there is no fear of your being a dull scholar.
It would be my interest to find you obtuse of intellect,
for to live and breathe in this atmosphere is a
happiness I never expected to enjoy—the library
itself is full compensation for more of my time than
I so freely give to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here followed another laugh, and as there was
now a perfect understanding between the young
lady and himself, he resolved to take no notice of it.
He arose, however, and shut the door, but he might
have spared himself the trouble for it was opened in
an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur smiled good-humoredly, and observed that
the merry gentleman was no doubt a privileged
person, one who had a control over the destinies of
the house, or such an eccentric way of amusing himself
would not be allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gordon colored, and was about to make
reply, when the laugh commenced again and continued
so long that there was an end of further conversation;
the lady rose with much embarrassment,
said she hoped to meet him there at breakfast, and
then departed through the door whence the laugh
came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur found it amounted to this—he must do one
of three things—to ask no questions, enter into no
conversation with Miss Gordon or any of the family—request
to take his meals by himself—or quit the
house. It was very irksome, certainly, to sit in perfect
silence when there was one person, at least,
who had conversational powers; it was likewise
irksome to see people moving about him all day, to
know that they all had communion with one another,
and that he alone should stalk about the house and
grounds in utter silence, save the two hours when
he was engaged in teaching. He walked out to
consider of it in the open air, and after an hour’s
ramble through groves and walks, breathing delicious
perfumes, he returned with the determination to
bear with the eccentric humor of the family and
remain with them until the winter set in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It certainly was very disheartening to meet no pleasant
voice on his entering the house, and to go to
his solitary chamber without a kind <span class='it'>good-night</span> from
a living soul, yet Arthur did not murmur. If he
were always thankful for “small benefits,” he had
reason to be grateful now, for here all the comforts
and luxuries of life were in abundance, and there
were two great pleasures added to all this—the
library and the beautiful face and pleasing manners
of his pupil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a long walk, and returned more elevated,
more grateful and humble than ever, it was a perfect
fairy-land all around, and why should the foolish
manners of the inmates of the house disturb his tranquillity.
He strove to keep the thought uppermost
that it was to these very eccentric people he owed
his happiness, so he was shown to the breakfast-room
with feelings disposed to submit to what,
under other circumstances, would be so difficult to
bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gordon was already there, and to Arthur’s
surprise and confusion, she held out her hand with
a kind good-morning and a pleasant smile. The
conversation was trifling, he kept a rein over his
thoughts and let none but such as were mere commonplace
go forth to excite the merriment of the
person in the next room, for Arthur presumed he
was there, as the door was still half open. Just at
parting he made the unlucky observation, that as he
had taken sufficient exercise for the morning he
should go again to the library, for there he should
find friends—friends who had always cheered and
consoled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He might, to be sure, have omitted the speech,
simple as it was, yet how could one so entirely
alone avoid feeling this loneliness—it was no cause
of mirth to others, certainly, and yet the man in the
next room laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a magnificent mind it was that planned
this library,” said Arthur, pointing to it, as the lady
and he left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled faintly, however, and as they separated,
replied that “it was planned—as well as the
house and grounds—by the laugher in the next
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas!” thought Arthur, when alone in the library,
“he is undoubtedly insane; he is, perhaps,
Miss Gordon’s father, or some near relative, and
being harmless, is allowed to amuse himself in any
way he likes. I see it all now, and his laughter
shall annoy me no longer; but where have I heard
it before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once the truth flashed upon him, in Mr.
Graham’s office, where he studied law for a year,
he often saw a gentleman by the name of Herman,
who certainly resembled the one who was the
owner of this estate. He was a great talker, and a
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
great laugher—the very clear, bell-like, musical
laugh he had heard so frequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present Mr. Herman was grave, taciturn,
frivolous and formal, with gray hair and broken
teeth; whereas the one he formerly knew was much
younger looking, with dark hair and perfect teeth.
Mr. Graham took great pleasure in his society, for
he was full of anecdote and had been a traveler;
Arthur, also, was much amused with his gay and
easy manners, and it was quite a regret to them all
when Mr. Herman left the city. Arthur had often
inquired after him, but Mr. Graham heard nothing
from or of him, and so he faded away from their
memory. It seemed, therefore, almost a certainty
that he was in some way connected with the family
of the Hermans where Arthur now was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day Arthur went through the same routine,
the young lady making great progress in German,
and he making great progress in love, for could
it be expected that he was to sit in earnest conversation
for two hours every day, and be at the same
table with her at all times, without losing his heart.
Whether Grace Gordon loved him in return, was
another matter; no one could judge if she did, for
her attentions were only those of a lady to a gentleman,
and even the haughty old lady, Madam Herman,
could find no fault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What puzzled Arthur more than any thing else
was this, Mr. Herman was never seen excepting at
dinner, where he went or what he did was a mystery;
he certainly never was in the library, for there
Arthur went at irregular times, so that he would of
course have been seen. He never was about the
grounds, and Arthur had no stated times of walking
or riding there; he might, however, take an airing
with Madam Herman, for she went out regularly,
and he sometimes met the carriage. He never
questioned the servants, for his honor and pride prevented
that, and Grace Gordon never alluded to her
family at all. Yet it must be presumed that the
young man had curiosity, and if he had not, there
were his friends at the inn, they were dying to know
what was going on within that wide extent of high
stone wall. The old schoolmaster of Berrydale,
who had read something of China in a geography
book, called it the <span class='it'>Celestial City</span>, and ardently
longed to enter the gates to take a peep there, he
did make one attempt, but the porter at the lodge
knew better what his place was worth than to let a
stranger enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur had now been there two months, and had
never left the place, his friends paid their evening
visits about once a week, for there had been a wedding
to occupy them, and Martha and Garry were
now man and wife. The winter was at hand, and
not a word was said of the period when his instructions
were to cease. Grace Gordon and he were
on the most friendly footing imaginable, and could
now converse very well in German, but though her
progress was astonishing, yet Madam Herman never
opened her lips to wonder or praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep, deeper in love did poor Arthur get every
day—a hopeless love he knew it to be, and yet he
would not have given up the tormenting pleasure
for the world; he wished, and dreamed his wishes
over and over again, that Grace Gordon was as poor
as himself, for he thought there was a possibility
then of winning her affections. For any thing he
knew to the contrary, she <span class='it'>might</span> be poor, but how
was he to find it out, unless the embargo on words
was taken off. At every turn he met a domestic,
but he knew them not even by name, all his wants
were supplied in the most exact and liberal manner,
but he asked no questions, and their respect for him
prevented any approach toward familiarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had walked and ridden over every part of the
estate with the exception of an inclosure, which he
was given to understand, in the very beginning, was
appropriated to the use of the domestics, and into
which visitors never entered. A road from the next
market-town reached this inclosure, and every thing
wanted for the family was brought here in carts and
wagons. A dense hedge of cedar, eight feet in height,
which extended to the right and left, prevented any
one from seeing what was passing on the other side,
and Arthur thought that this was all in good taste
and good keeping with the general plan. It was impossible
to guess at the extent of this inclosure, for
the hedge, or fence made a number of circuitous
bends, and thus rendered it deceptive to the eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning he strolled out as usual, and took the
path that led to the cedar-hedge, for the ground there
was well-beaten and very pleasant to the feet. He
walked leisurely, his mind occupied with the one
object of the deepest interest to him—Grace Gordon.
Starting from his day-dream he looked at his watch,
and found it time to return, that he might prepare for
breakfast. He quickened his pace, therefore, and
endeavored to retrace his steps, but he made a mistake
in one of the turnings and went backward
instead of forward. The error was not discovered
until he reached an immense iron-bound gate, which
at that moment was slowly opened by some one on
the other side. He waited until the man who was
opening the gate, and whose voice he heard, should
make his appearance, for he really was at a loss to
know which way to proceed. What was his surprise
to find that the gate-opener was Mr. Herman
himself, and that following him closely was a troop
of young people, all in high spirits, and apparently
on the most familiar terms with him. A second
glance assured him that it was not the Mr. Herman
of yesterday, gray-headed and formal, but the Mr.
Herman he formerly knew, with the same merry,
clear, ringing laugh which he recollected so well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentleman started on seeing Arthur, but appeared
not to know him, he raised his hat however,
and then turned to his young companions, who were
as much amazed as himself at the rencontre. He
could see at a glance that Grace Gordon was not
among them, but they evidently must be her friends.
They all walked briskly away, and as he turned to
look at them, saw that Mr. Herman was running at
full speed, and the whole party after him. He stood
at the open gate and for the first time saw the inside
of the hedge, and to his astonishment found that he
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
was in the rear of the mansion, for there, about a
quarter of a mile off, was the back-court, and several
of the domestics whom he recognized, passing
to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the men who stood near the gate, came
forward as Arthur was about entering, and said that
Miss Gordon was waiting breakfast for him, and
“that the chaise should be brought round in an instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is very curious,” thought Arthur, “why
not enter the house this way? Here I shall not
have to walk more than two or three hundred
yards, whereas it will be half an hour’s ride to
reach the front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the chaise was brought to the gate, and
after riding fast for twenty or thirty minutes, Arthur
was brought to the front of the house, and as quickly
as possible he made his toilet, and was ushered to
the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are welcome back,” said Miss Gordon,
blushing deeply, “I thought you had left us never to
return. We sent scouts after you in every direction,
fearing at first you had lost your way, but
Madam Herman thought that would be impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was possible,” said Arthur, “for I did
lose my way, and I hope you will pardon my
having kept breakfast waiting so long, I do not
deserve such kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, as to that,” said Grace Gordon, “there is no
one injured but yourself, for I breakfasted an hour
ago!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur was on the point of speaking of the troop
of young people that he met coming out of the gate,
but he stopped, for this was infringing on the rules—rules
which he never forgot one instant. Miss
Gordon seeing him about to speak, waited for a moment,
and then proceeded to pour out his tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you really lost your way, Mr. Hazarelle,
it is no wonder when you recollect how many
windings and turnings there are. If I were to
follow the cedar-hedge, I should undoubtedly be
puzzled, for that doubles and winds about in every
direction. Did you not meet any one in your
walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, several; I blundered along till I reached a
gate,—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!” said Miss Gordon, “and was the gate
open?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the gate was opened when I reached it, I
saw one of the domestics, or rather he saw me,
and it was from him I learned that the breakfast
was waiting. Miss Gordon,—I never was placed
in so awkward a position in my life. I have submitted
to conditions, which, to one of my nature,
are very painful and mortifying,—for you must yourself
despise me for submitting to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have acted honorably, Mr. Hazarelle,” said
she, with much feeling, “and an honorable man
must always be respected. You may be assured
that I deeply feel for the mortification and privations
you endure, and would lessen them if I could.
One day or other—very soon perhaps—you will learn
why you have been thus bound down to rules which
must at least appear strange, if not ridiculous. You
will find us grateful for the service you have rendered
me, and I hope to be under obligations to you
for several months to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grateful!—Miss Gordon,—it is for me to speak
of gratitude, for there has been as much happiness
crowded in the few months of my residence here as
would spread over the whole of an ordinary life. I
shall leave my heart, and all that life is worth in this
beautiful retreat, and that I may not be utterly miserable
by incurring your hate, it is better for me to
go as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you must not talk of leaving us yet,” said
she, pretending not to understand him, “for how
shall I get on with the German? I am not so well
grounded in the language, as that I can study by
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can improve without assistance, I assure
you, and you will have opportunities this winter of
meeting with many who speak the language. As to
me, though I shall be near you when you are in the
city, yet the difference in our prospects will prevent
our meeting,—I shall be nothing there but a humble
clerk; or perhaps, a humble teacher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears came in the young lady’s eyes, but she
did not dare to trust her voice, and Arthur proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is not a more solitary being in the world
than myself, for I do not know that I have a relation,
and yet there is no one that so ardently desires the
love and sympathy of kindred. With a heart thus
alive to tender emotions, judge, therefore, dear Miss
Gordon, how impossible it is not to admire the
beauty, talent, and excellence of the lovely being
who honors me with her confidence. I have
awakened from this bright dream, and must go
while I have the power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gordon rose, but trembled so much that she
was compelled to sit again. Arthur approached to
bid her farewell, for he now found that it was impossible
to remain near her after making this confession,
but seeing her distress he drew back, and said
in a low voice, he would write a few lines of thanks
before he left the house. Just as he was leaving the
room, he had the glimpse of a gentleman, who appeared
to come from the library, and it occurred to
him that it must be Mr. Herman. He was too much
agitated, however, to dwell on so trifling a circumstance,
yet he could not help wondering which of
the two gentlemen it was. When in his chamber,
he wrote to Mr. Herman, thanking him for all his
kindness and attention to his pleasures and comforts,
and regretting that it was not in his power to remain
longer. He gave his respectful compliments to
Madam Herman and Miss Gordon, and said that he
should send for his effects in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servant took the letter to Mr. Herman, who
by note requested Arthur to meet him in the library
before he departed. After writing a few lines to
Miss Gordon, our hero left his pleasant chamber,—and
no one can imagine with what regret,—and entered
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
the library. Mr. Herman as usual, waved his
hand to a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are leaving us, Mr. Hazerelle,” said he, “I
presume you think Miss Gordon is sufficiently advanced
in her studies to get on without a teacher.—Is
that your reason for going at this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Gordon has made great progress,” said
Arthur, “and if she could meet with a few clever
Germans now and then, she would soon be master
of the language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you leave us because you think she has no
further need of your assistance, or have you other
reasons; we have no wish to part with you for a
month or two, if convenient for you to remain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Herman,” said Arthur, rising, his face
crimsoned all over, “have you never been young—do
you forget that I am but twenty-four, and that
my heart is as susceptible as if I were heir to all this
estate? Do you think it possible to be in the society
of so lovely a woman as Miss Gordon without becoming
attached to her? I assure you, sir, that this
was unforeseen by me. Had I been aware of her
excellencies, I should not have placed myself in a
situation which I know is to render me unhappy for
life. You ask for my reasons, I tell them to you
frankly—good-morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of all the agitation which this avowal
called forth, Arthur could not avoid observing the
effect it had upon Mr. Herman. He rose slowly, his
eyes were opened to the utmost, and his hands were
outspread, but he spoke not; in fact, the boldness
and honesty of the speech took him completely by
surprise—and Arthur had walked out of the house before
he recovered his recollection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Arthur had not made known his intention to
the servants, for the whole was the impulse of the
moment, no carriage was in waiting; but before he
had proceeded a mile, the chaise and ponies overtook
him, and on entering it, he saw his carpet-bag,
trunk, and dressing-case in the bottom of the carriage.
As he was now released from all obligations, he
asked the coachman whether Mr. Herman had a
brother. The man said he had not. He then inquired
whether the gentleman who came through the
gate where he stood, in the morning, was any relation
of the family? The answer was, he did not
know. As it was evident that the fellow had instructions
not to be communicative, Arthur forbore
further question—and they rode on at a rapid pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero had at that moment vague thoughts of
rising in the world, penniless though he was, having
an indistinct hope, too, that Miss Gordon would listen
to his suit, if he had an independence to offer her.
As to the old lady or her formal son, he did not
trouble himself about their approbation; in fact, he
knew that, as far as their approval went, the thing
was entirely out of the question. He had, however,
given Mr. Herman a good fright about it, and this
amused poor Arthur in the midst of his painful feelings—and
he wondered what Madam Herman would
say when told of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they did not reach the porter’s lodge, and yet
they drove fast, and nearly half an hour had elapsed.
On looking round—for he had been so absorbed in
thought as not to observe the road they were going—he
saw that they were riding in an easterly direction,
and presently they entered a thick woods. He
told the coachman that he was taking him the wrong
road, and that he must turn back; but the man said
they would come out right in a few minutes; that
he thought it would be a pleasant ride this way, as
Mr. Hazerelle had never been there before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving the woods they got on a common
wagon road, and then making a circuit of half a
mile, they reached the lodge; and the porter stood
there ready to assist in taking out the luggage. As
soon as it was placed on the floor of the room, the
coachman jumped on the seat, and was out of
sight in a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Step this way,” said the porter; “please to go
down these steps, and then walk to the end of that
long passage, and you will see a white door, through
which you are to pass; you will there meet with a
friend, who will conduct you safely to Berrydale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not go out at this door, my friend? This is
the one leading to the stage-road—I prefer going
this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So should I, too,” said the porter, “if I thought
there was any harm in going a pleasanter road.
You will not repent going to the end of the long
passage. You have only to descend six steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Often as I have been here,” said Arthur, “I
never saw that dark passage before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a very good reason,” said the porter; “the
door was always locked, and Mr. Herman had the
key. He came here this morning and opened it himself.
You perceive that this door is locked, and that
the windows are grated—so that, in truth, there is
no way of getting out but down through that narrow
passage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if that is the case,” said Arthur, good-humoredly,
“I must go that way. This is, however,
the oddest of all odd things; but it is of a piece with
the rest,” continued he to himself—respect for Grace
Gordon preventing him from speaking lightly of the
family. He descended and walked through the long
passage which was only lighted at the end by a small
window, or loop-hole, giving just light enough to
see the white door, a flight of seven or eight steps
leading to it. On opening it, he entered a handsomely-furnished
parlor, with a table in the centre,
on which was some fine fruit. He did not stop, however
to taste it, but went to a folding-door opposite,
and to his surprise, found himself in a lady’s boudoir—for
there, on the table, were books, needle-work,
and embroidery. What can all this mean, thought
Arthur; surely the Herman family are a little deranged.
Pride and wealth have caused them to act
thus strangely. Heaven grant that Grace Gordon has
none of their blood in her veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this thought passed through his mind, he heard
the clear, gay laugh of his old acquaintance. For he
now was convinced that it was the Mr. Herman he
formerly knew, and whom he had seen that morning.
He sprang to a door, which stood partly open, and
there, to his surprise, he saw, not Mr. Herman, but
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
Godfried Darg, and his two dogs, Barker and
Growler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! are you here, my good friend,” said Arthur,
shaking hands with him. “You gave us the slip in an
odd way; and I have to thank you for a very valuable
present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you spit in old Barnes’ face, and give him a
kick, as I requested?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Arthur, laughing, “I had no chance;
for instead of becoming teacher to a score or two of
village children, I had the honor of—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, I know it; Herman told me all, and
told me of your fine speech this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why who are you, that can be so familiar with
so reserved a gentleman as Mr. Herman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who am I? Why plain Godfried Darg. But
are you not a pretty fellow, to fall in love with a lady
so entirely out of your reach. Did I not give you a
dressing-case, in which lay the miniature of the
pretty little girl that is to be your wife? Did not my
note tell you that you were not to open the box till
Barker and Growler gave you leave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have I not obeyed your directions?” said
Arthur, smiling; “if you take the trouble to go to
the porter’s lodge, you will see the case, and find
that the box is untouched. Confound all this mystery—what
does it mean? Why am I singled out
for such necromancy; and why am I here in this
singular place, when my wish is to be with my quiet,
honest friends of Berrydale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you took me at my word, and never
opened the little box?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had two very good reasons for not doing it—the
first was that you requested me not to do it until
I had consulted your dogs, if you remember; and
the second reason was, that the picture which you
said the box contained, would be broken if I attempted
it—at least so you said in your note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever read the letter which old Crosbie
told you to hand to Barnes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—it was destroyed, I heard; but I shall insist
on hearing the contents the moment I see Mr.
Crosbie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not ask him; here is the letter—I persuaded
the old ass, Barnes, to give it to me—there,
read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word,” said Arthur, laughing; “I do
not wonder at my dismissal; I am only surprised that
I was not complimented with the kick which you
requested me to bestow upon Barnes.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>To Mr. Barnes</span>,—Sir, The bearer of this letter
is a pert jackanapes, and is full of conceit. He
boasts that he will rule you, and all the gentlemen in
the neighborhood, with a rod of iron. He is going to
make you pull down the old school-house, and oblige
you to dress the boys in uniform. In short, he promises
himself that he will turn every thing upside
down, and leave you and your four respectable colleagues
out when it is time to elect new trustees.
He is so daring, that you must be cautious how you
act; and above all things, do not let him know the
contents of this letter—just dismiss him coolly when
he presents himself.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'><span class='sc'>P. Herman</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur read this curious epistle aloud, and started
when he saw the signature. “Surely,” said he,
“Mr. Herman, the solemn, grave, upright owner of
Herman Hall, never could have written this letter—if
he did, he is crazy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did write it, and he is not crazy; but why
do we sit talking nonsense here when so much is to
be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know what <span class='it'>your</span> business may be, Mr.
Darg, but mine is to get away from Herman Hall as
quickly as possible; will you accompany me to
Berrydale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I; why there is a great deal going on here;
for instance, there are a number of pretty girls in the
house, and there is to be a wedding. Ah, you start,
yet I tell you the truth, there is to be a wedding
here this very evening; instead of going to Berrydale
you had better remain here and get a peep at the
bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is Miss Gordon—but that is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why is it impossible? she is very beautiful
and very accomplished; so that it is the most likely
thing in the world. Why, I would take her without
a cent to her portion, if she would have me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur now determined to find his way out of this
mysterious place, and he was the more anxious as it
was barely possible that what Darg said respecting
Miss Gordon might be true, so he walked to the door
opposite and opened it, and there lay his carpet-bag,
his trunk and dressing-case—he turned to express his
surprise, but Darg had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will open the case now,” said Arthur, “and
trust to luck not to break the miniature. I am the
sport of some one, and I will put an end to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So saying, he opened the dressing-case, and was
just in the act of breaking open the little steel-box,
when Galton Springle stood before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found you at last,” said the man, “why
how closely you have kept yourself. Did I not tell
you to leave your address at the inn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur was stooping over the case when Springle
entered, and on raising up suddenly, he struck the
man in the face and crushed the spectacles; instead
of letting Arthur assist him, he rushed into the adjoining
room and shut the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do believe the fellow had a mask on his face,”
thought Arthur, “for I heard something crackle and
crush as my head struck him. What brings such a
man in a house of this kind; and if he has a mask,
why may not Darg be disguised also?—and old Crosbie,
it always struck me that his eyes were too
deeply set. If I come in contact with them again I
will soon find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had scarcely touched the dressing-case to recommence
his attempt, when in came the identical
Mr. Crosbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are there, my friend, are you!” said Arthur,
seizing him; “you gave me a letter to Mr.
Barnes, did you; I shall take the liberty of tweaking
your nose for the compliment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off came the nose, and off went Mr. Crosbie, and
after him rushed Arthur; but being unacquainted
with the intricacies of the place he lost sight of him,
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
and on opening a door what was his surprise to find
himself in a large parlor, surrounded by a number of
persons, and Mr. Herman in the midst of them,
laughing merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk in, walk in, Mr. Hazerelle,” said Mr.
Herman; “what, you found out that old Crosbie
had a paper nose, were you not ashamed to expose
the poor fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Arthur had no ear nor eye for him—in the
centre of the group stood Grace Gordon, holding in
her hand the little steel-box, which a servant had
that moment put there. By her side was Abram
Snow, looking just as quiet and grave as when in
the counting-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After shaking hands, Arthur turned again to Grace
Gordon, for she seemed to be the most sane among
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are Barker and Growler?” said she,
laughing. “Godfried Darg, call your dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Herman whistled, and both dogs came racing
into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Arthur,” said Mr. Herman, “here are
Barker and Growler, set down the steel-box and let
them open the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no desire to see the face of any other lady
than this one,” said Arthur, approaching Miss Gordon
and taking her hand. “There is some mystery
here which I cannot fathom, but with her I am safe;
whatever may be the plans and manœuvres of
others, here there is no guile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said Mr. Herman, “the dogs have
opened the box with one bite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or rather, you pressed a spring and opened it,”
said Grace, laughing, “for I saw you. Now let Mr.
Hazerelle see the miniature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, Arthur,” said Mr. Herman, “stand
behind Miss Gordon while she opens the box; now
look over her shoulder and see the lady you are to
marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur looked over the shoulder of Grace, and he
saw her lovely face reflected from the little mirror
in her hand—it was the most natural thing in the
world to kiss the cheek which was so near his lips,
and there was a laugh from every one in the room,
the clear, musical laugh of his old tormentor being
heard above the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Herman, “we did not intend to
have the ceremony performed till evening, but as
Arthur has pulled off old Crosbie’s nose, and crushed
Springle’s face, the plot cannot go on, so we will
ask the clergyman to walk in—he is in the library—and
put poor Arthur out of suspense. Welcome Mr.
Green, and you, too, good lady—ah, there comes
Garry Lovel and his wife, and all the boys. Yes,
Arthur, I know how to appreciate the kindness of
your friends, and see—there is good Mrs. May, too—am
I not a good manager?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every thing was ready, and before Arthur could
ask for an explanation of what had occurred, he stood
up and became the happy husband of Grace Gordon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now step in this room,” said Mr. Herman, after
the ceremony was over, “and let me tell you how
this has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, never mind,” said Arthur; “I care not how
it has been brought about, for the sole wish of my
heart has been gratified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Grace Gordon has no fortune, and as you
have none, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arthur,” said Grace, “bear with him just now,
he is jesting. Mr. Herman, did you not promise me
that all mystery should cease the moment we were
married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, I submit. And now be as happy as
you both deserve—after this I must act like other
folks, I presume, but I shall never enjoy myself
thoroughly again.”</p>

<hr class='tbk128'/>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Herman became his own master and heir to
a large estate at twenty-one. He began to build
immediately, and the plan of the house and grounds
was a type of his character. He was full of plots
and contrivances, and there were, therefore, long
passages under ground and labyrinths at every turn.
Arthur Hazerelle was his intimate friend, and prevented
him from ruining himself by taking the
management of his pecuniary affairs, so that at the
end of five years the house and grounds were finished
to suit the whimsical fancy of the owner, and
his income was not diminished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, Mr. Hazerelle loved the same lady
on whom his friend had placed his affections—but
this did not disturb the friendship of the young men.
Mr. Hazerelle was accepted by the young lady, and
his friend withdrew from the world, determined
never to marry. In the course of a few years, Mr.
Hazerelle and his wife both died, leaving one son to
the guardianship of Mr. Herman. Aware of his own
faults, faults which he considered as having arisen
from an early knowledge of the great wealth to
which he was heir, he determined upon bringing up
his friend’s child in ignorance of what he intended
to do for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was one of the most active men in the world,
and luckily his means were excellent, so that he
could execute all the romantic schemes that he
planned. He took no one into his confidence, but
through the means of his great wealth he had the
power of accomplishing whatever he wished. Every
thing which happened to Arthur was in consequence
of his agency. He had him educated in the most
eccentric manner, giving him an insight into law,
medicine and commerce. Every change in the
young man’s prospects which appeared the result
of accident, was owing to him, and that he might
learn something of Arthur’s real character, he frequently
lived in the same house with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he found that Arthur was humble and
good-tempered, and that he struggled hard against
his fate, he thought it was high time to make him
amends. He was sure that prosperity would not
undo the work of years, and that he had acted his
part as a guardian well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of his gardeners lost his wife, leaving a child
a few weeks old—it was a girl, and her father did
not live long after the death of his wife. Mr. Herman
took the child, and determined, if she had a
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
good intellect, to educate her for Arthur. She was
both intelligent and beautiful, so that he waited with
impatience for the time when Arthur should be
twenty-four, as that, according to his notion, was
the age of discretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Gordon had been in his confidence from
the time she could comprehend it, and from dwelling
upon the plan so long had learned to like it.
Many and many a time had she seen Arthur when
in the city with Mr. Herman, but she could not
persuade him to bring Arthur to what might be considered
his own home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Herman never left off his love of mystery
and plotting, and when little children hung round
him he would turn himself into a gypsy and tell their
fortunes, which made them laugh; or he would be
a shipwrecked sailor, and tell a melancholy story,
and make them weep; but he seldom told them
a sad tale, for he loved to hear them laugh, and he
was the greatest laugher of them all.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Thy footsteps leave a blessing for the curse—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For this I bless thee, and all this would take</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Into my soul of souls, and walk with Thee;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet not for these do I so much adore;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But thou didst go.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Down to the very grave—like unto ours</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy death-pang—thy effulgent limbs did lie</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“In cold obstruction.” Oh! pitying soul of Man!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For this I praise thee—worship and bow down,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sing with the evening stars and morning light.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When the great glory of the sun walks forth,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I shout the resurrection and new life;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For thou with light didst penetrate the dark,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy footsteps waked “old chaos and dim night.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Legions of melancholy shapes that wailed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their being, mourning they should be a blot</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upon the garments of enrobed light,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their voice a discord when the swelling hymn</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In God’s majestic dome rolled through all space,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In silence saw thy foot the barrier press</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of their uncheered vault, with a strong tread,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Itself a light, till downward more and more</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The inverted arch recoiled, and thou didst stand,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Amid their ghostly and distorted shapes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Serene and fair, thrice beautiful and calm.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Death and Hell—Darkness and Pain! Oh, my God!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>We see their marks, we know not what they are,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But Thou, oh Christ! didst walk the dread abysm,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And from thyself a permeating light</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Made darkness day. The adamantine bond</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Broke from its clasp, and knew itself no more;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The jangling chord, that its own discord wailed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Slid into music with a heavenly song,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Chaotic shapes, that slunk from light, behold</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy beauty and upsprung to perfect grace;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The shadow was no more a shadow left—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Deformity no more could find a place—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Evil had turned itself unto the Good,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For Light and Love had breathed themselves again</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upon our earth, unto the very depths</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where Death and Darkness reigned; and God had said,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As when Creation woke, “Let there be light”—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Oh Christ! dear Christ! for this I worship Thee.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thou didst tread through all man’s fearful pathway,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And we go down unto the grave in trust,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For we behold thy footstep there, a light,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And catch the trailing of thy robe, as on</p>
<p class='dramaline'>We go in our dim way through death to Thee;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And not without a hope, thus shadowed forth,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> a large, pleasant garden, laid out in the old fashioned
style, two young friends were walking together
one summer evening. Sometimes they would
sit down on a grassy slope, looking at the bright
clouds in the western sky; then rising together in
the most friendly manner, they would walk beneath
the arching trees, stopping often to pluck flowers,
and many-patterned leaves, from the low hanging
boughs, but ever and anon they talked busily together,
and their conversation soon turned upon their
early recollections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember well the first time I ever saw you,
Magdalene,” commenced the younger one. “It was
a still summer day, soon after we first moved here.
Every thing at home was in confusion. Our scanty
load of furniture had been tossed into our neglected
old house, apparently to arrange itself. Our one girl,
with noisy undirected zeal, went stumbling about,
falling over chairs, and breaking crockery; while
my poor father, sick and irritable, lay upon a bed,
fuming at every thing. Unnoticed and wondering,
I sat in a corner, amused for a time by the chaos by
which I was surrounded. But at length I grew very
weary at the voices of displeasure and vexation,
that grated so harshly upon my ears. Looking up at
the window, I saw how brightly the sun was shining
upon the green waving trees in the avenue beyond;
and with a sudden longing for quiet I slipped out at
the door. Our own garden, a square of bare ground
was by no means inviting; but beyond grew a row
of tall, beautiful trees, that seemed to bound a large
flower-garden, and farther still, a little wood with a
low stile, enchanted my fancy, and promised me an
easy entrance. Oh! I cannot tell you how beautiful
it looked, to a child brought up in the close dismal
streets of a large city. I felt as if I stood in
Fairy-land. Every thing seemed to have a marvelous
light,—a mysterious shading cast over it, which
gave me a sensation, as if something strange and
wonderful were hidden behind every bush, or at
every corner around which I passed. As I went on,
my childish attention was attracted by the pretty iron
railings which bounded the garden, and looking between
them, I saw a well-kept lawn, and smooth
walks, winding around mounds of green turf. On
one of these mounds, you were sitting, reading with
a calm air, perfectly in keeping with the scene
around. I thought you much older than you really
were, for you were tall for your age. You seemed
to me so striking in your dark blue dress, with your
beautiful features, that I immediately ran over in my
mind all the heroines I had ever read of, but as I
could not find one that exactly resembled you, I
thought of a name for you, and had commenced to
connect a long story with it, when a voice from the
house called you, and to my great disappointment,
you went in. I continued for awhile to look in upon
the wide garden, but I felt as if the life of the scene,
and the heroine of my story had departed with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! yes, Franzchen,” answered her companion,
“from the first, you were romantic and fanciful.
But I remember well, with what childish superiority
I at first looked down upon you. When Aunt Katrine
told me one day, that she was going to bring
little Franzchen Deshalbens to see me,—I cried
contemptuously—What, Aunt!—That girl, with
such a little unwashed face, and such great black
eyes to see me!—I don’t like babies for play-fellows!
But before you had been with me long, I
learned to like you well enough, and think I might
possibly find pleasure in the companionship of one
younger than myself. You remember, we went into
the garden, and as we sat upon the mound, you
told me the story of ‘the fair lady and the genii.’
I soon forgot my disdain, and besought you to continue,
until the moon rose upon your endless and enchanting
recitals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed! Magda. I too remember with
what dignity you received me. But that only
pleased me, because it corresponded with the character
I had drawn out for you, of a great princess.
But I think I should have been a little overawed, if
Aunt Katrine had not spoken so kindly to me.
Then when I commenced to speak of my favorite
stories, you seemed to think such things so far beneath
you, that I did not expect the interest with
which you afterward listened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, Franzchen, I used to come to the
fence at the foot of the garden, to see you sitting on
the ground, building a castle with small sticks, and
you, little muddy thing, would look up with your
great dark eyes, to tell me of some new tale you
had been reading, and you would fix upon a character
in it for each of us. Sometimes you were the
hero or heroine of the piece, and would tell the
whole in the first person. What a changeful, chameleon-like
creature you made yourself out to be.
Now you were the brave knight, Sir George, and
rode fighting for Christendom; and now as the sorrowful
Griselda, you told me of your cruel, task-exacting
aunt, until the tears came into my eyes; or you
spoke of yourself as ‘the fair one with the locks
of gold,’ while all the time your curling black hair
fell over your face. Do you know, Franzchen, I
often envy you those curling dark locks? Stay now,
while I arrange these white jasmins in your hair.
Flowers never look so well in mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Magda, how can you envy me, with your
beautiful, light, braided hair? Do you know, last
night, I thought you looked like an old Grecian
statue, with your fine features, and tall, fine figure;
and you spoke to every one with so much ease and
self-possession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now! Franzchen. You are running
away again from all common sense, into the crazy
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
region of your imagination. Do not try to make a
heroine of me, I beseech you, or expect me to take
all your fancies for realities. But it is growing late.
I hope you are not too romantic to eat any supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they returned to the house, they were met by
Aunt Katrine. “Here, girls! come quickly,” she
cried. “I have a letter for Magdalene, from her
father’s sister, the high and mighty Baroness of Radgardin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this aunt of Magda’s,—a pretty, foolish, ambitious
woman, had married a nobleman of high
birth, and great wealth, whose sister was a margravine.
Great indeed, was the dignity of the noble
Baron of Radgardin, and great was the elation and
self-consequence of his baroness. Had not Magda
grown up uncommonly beautiful and striking in appearance,
it may well be doubted whether she
would have taken so much interest in her, as she
now seemed to. But as it was, she liked to have
her handsome niece with her, and had already many
ambitious designs connected with her. Her darling
scheme at present, was to marry her to the young
Count Hugo, the son of an old friend of the baron’s,
and she constantly remarked that Magda, a beauty,
and somewhat of an heiress, should hold up her
head, and remember, that she was the niece of the
Baroness of Radgardin, and the grand-daughter of the
Baron of Roderkamp. She had now written to invite
her to pay her a visit, as she expected to have
much noble company at her house, to whom she
was anxious to introduce her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the rest, she was to be honored by the
presence of Count Hugo, and she went so far as to
hint that her family were always remarkable for
beauty, and as some of them had already done so
well in the world, Magda also, under her guidance,
might do equally so. At the close, she added, “My
dear child, you must come. I have seen your father,
and he said that the only obstacle that would prevent
your coming was, that you had a friend staying with
you, whom you had promised to accompany on a
visit. You must prevail upon your friend to delay
this visit, and come with you. My carriage shall
be at your door next Tuesday—so be sure and be
ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magda laughed heartily as she read the letter.
“But we will go, Franzchen,” she said, “for we
shall have a fine time no doubt, and besides that, I
have seen this Count Hugo, and like him very
much. So does my father. I have often heard him
speak very highly of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Franzchen looked upon the matter very seriously,
and never doubting but that Magda had only
to appear to conquer the whole world, she cried,—“But
Carl Engleford, Magda, what is to become of
poor Carl Engleford?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, never mind Carl Engleford! I tell you,
Franzchen, I’m very ambitious, and I want to see
Count Hugo again. But we must write to your
cousin and delay our visit there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This cousin of Franzchen’s whom they spoke of
visiting, was a good-natured, but high-tempered
woman, who had never been able to bear with Monsieur
Deshalbens’ perverse and irritable temper; but
at his death she would gladly have taken charge of
her little cousin; Magda however would never consent
that she should be separated from her, and they
compromised the matter by going often to pay her a
long visit, but this might easily be delayed on so important
an occasion as the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall want a good many things,” said
Magda, with a prudent and business like air, after a
few minutes consideration; “I shall go at once to
my father and get a draft for each of us. Shall I
manage every thing myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray do,” said Franzchen, who was still thinking
of Carl Engleford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magda found plenty to occupy her, and busied
herself with preparing and packing; but at length
the eventful day arrived, and with it the baroness’s
carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Lisette to go with us?” asked Franzchen, as
she saw the girl descending the stairs, bonnet on and
band-box and parcel in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. We must have a waiting-maid at
Radgardin castle,” answered her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set off in high spirits. After a long and
somewhat wearisome ride they approached the
castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a magnificent building, situated upon a
winding river, which swelled out into a little lake
before it. The commencement of the water was
hidden from view by deep, dark woods, terminated
by a distant range of blue mountains. Franzchen
was fairly enchanted, as the coachman, exciting the
spirited horses, whirled them at full speed along the
smooth, level road entering the extensive pleasure-grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Magda, look, look!” she cried, “what
beautiful glimpses we catch of the water as we pass
among the trees, and how finely the road winds
down to the river!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magda had been there before, but she now joined
heartily in her friend’s admiration. Soon they drew
up at the gate of the castle, were ushered up stairs,
and received in the vestibule by the baroness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear Magda, how delighted I am to see
you—I knew you would come. Although I am rusticating
here in the country just now, we shall not
be very dismal, I can assure you. I have a delightful
party coming to see me. The Margrave and
Margravine of Baralt, the Landgrave of Durathor,
the Dowager Countess of Hinkle, Baron Logrum,
and better than all—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here she was interrupted by her niece, who drew
Franzchen forward to introduce her to her aunt,
who immediately drew herself up—“was much gratified
at the honor Mademoiselle Deshalbens had
done her in accompanying her niece to her little
country-house”—“hoped she was not fatigued by
the journey,” and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the usual inquiries and compliments had
been gone through with, they were conducted to a
handsome room, opening on a balcony overlooking
a modern flower-garden behind the castle. The
baroness left them to rest and refresh themselves.
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
She was soon followed by a servant bearing fruits
and refreshments on a gilded waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Franzchen thought not of eating as she stood
at the window looking out upon the terrace. So
looking doubtfully at her companion, who was
busily engaged directing Lisette to unpack the
trunks, she began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Magda, how pleasant it would be to run
down and look at the river. We could so easily
descend these steps and pass through that gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed, Franzchen. You must lie down
immediately and go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! I go to sleep! It isn’t night yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we have been traveling all day, and to-night
we are to be introduced to a great party. If we do
not rest now we shall be horribly weary when evening
comes, and look frightful and stupid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Magda, I’m not sleepy at all. It will be of
no use to lie down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must, Franzchen; you must eat and
sleep, or you will look thin and pale, and I don’t
want you to look like a scarecrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to look like a scarecrow, either.
Do you think I shall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you will if you don’t lie down. Now
do, dear Franzchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, if I must,” said Franzchen, sighing
as she turned away from the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magda smiled as she saw her lie down and in a
few minutes fall fast asleep, but without thinking of
following her example, she was turning again to
Lisette, when the baroness looked in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not want to rest, my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, aunt; I never sleep in the day time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, leave Lisette and come with me a
moment, I want to have a talk with you.” So saying,
she led the way to the balcony, and after a few
compliments on her manners and appearance, she
began. “Now, my dear child, who is this friend of
yours, this Mademoiselle Deshalbens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is an orphan,” answered Magda. “Her
father came to our neighborhood when she was very
young, and purchased a house near to ours. When
he died he left her, with a moderate fortune, to the
guardianship of my father, who had taken a great
deal of interest in her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was her father? Were you acquainted
with him before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they were perfect strangers, but we liked
Franzchen so much, that we would gladly have had
her with us always. Monsieur Deshalbens was
French. His health was very poor from the time
we first became acquainted with him; his wife, who
was a German, had died some time before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Frenchman! and nobody I suppose. My dear
Magda, you must be careful what acquaintances you
form. At your time of life it is very important.
Now, don’t look so indignant, my dear, I’m not
finding fault with your friend in the least, you
know, for she seems to be a harmless little creature,
and her manners are very pretty, only wanting in
style of course. But how much better it would be
if all your acquaintances were selected from high-life,
and your intimate friend should be a baroness,
or a lady something, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If all she wants is a little mann—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now, my dear, why should you take
offense at what I have said? It was only meant to
guide your conduct in future. Do not let us speak
of it any more now. I want you to give me your
opinion about a little walk I am having made down
here. Come, let us go and see it.” So saying, she
descended from the balcony with a smiling countenance,
and Magda followed, to hear that Count
Hugo was expected every moment—was such a
handsome young man—so brave, so distingué, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Franzchen opened her eyes, it was quite
evening. The room was brightly lighted by a chandelier
from the ceiling, and Magda was standing beside
her, waiting for her to awaken. She jumped
up, wondering that she had forgotten herself for so
long a time, and asking how her companion had
slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellently well, dear Franzchen. But it is time
you dressed. The baroness has been here. She
says that every one has come, and we must descend
to the drawing-room as soon as we can. Come, I
will arrange your hair myself, for I have set Lisette
to altering a little your white gauze dress with the
blue trimming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how will you get dressed, Magda?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you see that Lisette has already braided
my hair? She can finish dressing me in a minute.
Now, pray, don’t open your eyes so wide. I did
not sleep quite as long as you, that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my white gauze dress with the blue trimming!
Where did it come from? I never saw it
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I ordered it, to be sure, and plenty more
beside. Did you think, you little ignoramus, that
we were coming without any thing to wear? But
now, let me do your hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How kind you always are, Magda! I never
thought of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that. You never paid a visit to the
Baroness of Radgardin before, and don’t know of
what importance such things are in her eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Magda, what are you putting those pearls
in my hair for? They are the prettiest ornaments
you have. You must wear them yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! I’m going to wear my little tiara, my
golden crescent, that we used to call the crown. It
is more suitable, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suitable! To what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, to my exalted expectations, to be sure!
You forget Count Hugo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he come?” asked Franzchen, eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, some time ago; and I have seen and talked
with him. There! Now, pray, don’t give such another
start, for you have disarranged all the curls I
had just finished brushing. Sit still, and I will tell
you all about it. I did not feel at all inclined to
sleep, and I went down the terrace, with the baroness,
to see a new walk she is having made. We were
in full discussion concerning it, when we heard a
voice behind us and turning, saw Count Hugo, who
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
had left his horse with a servant at the entrance of
the park, that he might, as he told us, have the
pleasure of walking slowly through it, and enjoying
the fine views.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like him for that!” cried Franzchen, who
was growing quite excited. “That is just what I
should have liked to have done! I hate those indifferent
sort of persons, who pass every thing by
without the least admiration, and would not walk a
step out of their way to see the most beautiful scene
in the world. But what next, Magda?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that we had a pleasant little conversation,
and I like him better than ever. After paying his
respects to the baroness, he hastened to claim my
acquaintance, and stayed talking to me until my
aunt, alarmed for my toilette, carried him off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am so glad! I’m sure he must like you
very much, Magda! It seems like a dream. How
stupid I was to sleep all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Magda, quietly, as she gave the
last touch to Franzchen’s hair. “There comes Lisette
with the dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The toilette was at length completed, and Magdalene
announced her intention of descending immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Franzchen, who always delighted in seeing her
friend handsomely dressed, could not refrain from a
little innocent admiration, but danced around her,
examining her from head to foot, and exclaiming,
“You look like some great queen, Magda, in your
white satin dress, and your little golden coronal.”
Magda smiled quietly, and thought little Franzchen
did not look at all amiss in the white gauze dress,
her dark curls fastened back by the bandeau of pearls,
and her eyes sparkling with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they were ushered into the brilliant saloon, the
baroness came forward and introduced them to one
and another, until Franzchen was almost bewildered.
First they must curtsey to this stout lady in blue,
and the noble margravine, then smile sweetly on
that good-tempered old gentleman, and gratefully on
this condescending great landgrave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then advanced from the crowd, a thin, elderly
gentleman, with rather a vacant countenance, and
stiff manner, accompanied by a younger one, with
bright, brown eyes, and a lively, pleasant face.
They welcomed Magda with much friendliness, and
were introduced to Mademoiselle Deshalbens as
Baron Radgardin and Count Hugo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Franzchen’s eyes fairly danced. She felt as if
she was in an enchanted land, and although, after
the first introduction was over she was left almost
unnoticed in the crowd, she was fully occupied in
admiring the brilliancy of the lights, the gay appearance
of the lamps, and above all, in watching Magda
dancing with Count Hugo, who evidently admired
her greatly, and seized every opportunity of conversing
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length a sandy-haired young man, whose countenance
left the impression of a perfect blank upon
Franzchen’s mind, requested her to dance. She
arose to join the set, but was so busy thinking and
admiring, that she hardly knew what she was doing;
but she danced with the unconscious grace that was
natural to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle Deshalbens moves like a zephyr,”
remarked the count, who had been watching the
new-comer with considerable satisfaction—and
Magda smiled assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the dancing and supper were over, a walk
was proposed upon the terrace—and every gentleman
hastened to escort some fair lady to the promenade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Franzchen stood waiting, she saw the count
looking for Magda, who was already walking with
Baron Logrum. As he turned away disappointed,
he noticed her standing alone, and hastened to beg
the honor of conducting her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She desired nothing more than the opportunity of
becoming acquainted with him; and although at first
she stood a little in awe of him, she had a natural
gift at making herself at home with every one, and
inducing them to talk. But the count was no difficult
subject. He spoke with the ease of an intelligent,
well educated man, and the wit of a young
and lively one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He commenced at once about Magdalene, whom
he rejoiced again to have met. Then they admired
the pleasant walk, the fine view, and the bright
moonlight; and at length they wandered off into a
comparison of their favorite writers, whom they
discussed with an animation that astonished a very
prim and proper couple, who walked just behind
them, alternately answering with yes and no’s, to
questions asked at minute intervals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time they returned to the saloon, Franzchen
felt almost as if they were old friends, and thought
how much better one free and earnest conversation
was than a thousand silent meetings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like the count very much,” she said, as she returned
with Magda to their room, after the company
had dispersed; “and he talks so much of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not wonder so much now, that I could
forget Carl Engleford, while thinking of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Franzchen was obliged to confess that
she was no longer surprised at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may easily be imagined that the two friends
rose rather late upon the ensuing morning; but that
was the custom in that noble house—and the midday
sun was shining brightly when Lisette entered
with the coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magdalene and Franzchen sat opposite each other
in their loose morning-dresses, and entered into a
regular gossip, as they sipped their coffee, on the
events of the preceding day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked over the kind though stiff baron, the
ambitious baroness, the condescending landgrave,
and last, but not least, the agreeable young count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always had a high esteem for him,” said
Magda, “from what I have heard of him. And I
think he is more truly polite and polished than any
one I have ever met with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, too,” said Franzchen; “he is so
gentle and kind; and I like so much to see his eyes
twinkle, when he says any thing merry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he really has beautiful eyes, so full of life
and intelligence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
“And then, Magda, his manners are so simple
and unaffected. I was afraid, because he was a
count, and very rich, that he would be haughty and
self-conceited; but he is not so at all—is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the least,” responded Magda; and so
they agreed that they were very well pleased to
have met him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good news! good news!” cried the baroness,
when she next found Magda alone. “The count is
going to stay with us awhile, for he is quite at leisure
for some time to come. Ah! I know well enough
to whom it is owing. He was delighted with the
party last night, and expressed great pleasure at
meeting you here, expressing at the same time the
highest admiration of your appearance and manners—so
dignified and lady-like!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magda smiled, blushed, and said he was really too
complimentary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he admires you exceedingly; and he likes
your little friend, too. He says there is something
very bright and lovely in the expression of her face,
and that the contrast between you is very becoming
to you both. Was it not good-natured of him to
take so much notice of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he only showed a due discernment, I think,”
answered Magda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, you are so fond of her! But to do
her justice, she really dressed herself with good taste
last night, which is a thing I like to see. And you
did also, Magda; only I did not like your head-dress
quite so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is because nature has not bestowed upon
me such fine dark curls, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she has pretty hair. But, my dear, we
must make good use of the time while the count is
with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall certainly endeavor to,” said Magda, as
she went to join Franzchen and the count in the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One fine evening the two friends, accompanied by
Count Hugo, who was now their constant companion,
strolled down to the river. As they looked toward
the blue distant mountains, Franzchen wished for
wings that she might fly away to their dim summits;
but Magda thought it would be far more agreeable to
glide over the clear surface of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count seized upon the idea with alacrity.
“Yes, that is the very thing,” he cried. “And, see!
here is a little boat all ready. Will you not trust
yourselves to my guidance? I am a good boat’s-man,
I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, delightful!” cried Franzchen. “You shall
row us in the path that the moon has marked out for
us; and we will glide down the stream like the
fairies we hear of in old stories, in their little walnut-shell
boats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what if we should tip over?” suggested the
prudent Magda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we would float along like the sea-nymphs,
with flowing locks spread out upon the water. I
think, to bathe in this beautiful river would be quite
pleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And only think,” interposed the count, “what
a fine opportunity I should have of displaying my
gallantry in rescuing you by those flowing locks, and
swimming with you to the land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my poor head! It makes me shudder to
think of it,” said Magda, clasping her hands above
her. “That might do for water-nymphs, if they
have hair of ropes, and skin like leather; but for
poor human beings, me thinks, it would be more romantic
than agreeable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is really no danger,” replied the count;
“and I shall consider it as an imputation upon my
skill, if you do not try it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Franzchen jumped into the boat, Magda followed,
and Count Hugo, placing himself at the helm, soon
showed himself skillful in the use of the oar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moonlight shining like silver upon the still
water, the dark trees and bushes casting deep, mysterious
shadows upon the margin, the fresh evening
air, and the showers of diamonds falling from the
oars, all combined to carry Franzchen, keenly alive
to every thing picturesque, into the seventh heaven.
Unable to contain herself, she broke forth with her
clear voice into a little river song, in which she was
quickly joined by her companions. Then Count
Hugo begged for another, and another—and so they
floated on, making the echoes resound with sweet
sounds until they came to a little island, where the
count moored the boat to the shore, and springing out,
offered them his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made the circuit of the island, and then sat
down on the craggy roots of some old trees, looking
toward the dark woods on the opposite side of the
river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This little island reminds me of a story you were
telling me the other day, Franzchen,” said Magda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, tell it us! tell it us again!” said the count,
seating himself opposite to them. “This is the very
time and place for it; and that alone is needed to
make the evening perfect!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Franzchen thought it quite perfect already, but
she readily consented, on condition that they also
should relate something in their turn. She then
commenced a little anecdote concerning a prince,
who once possessed a large province, with a small
island upon the coast, to which his predecessors had
been so greatly attached, on account of its extreme
beauty, that they had built a palace upon it, and
held there their court during the fairest months of
the year. There, one by one, his ancestors had been
gathered to their rest—and tradition associated with
that spot the fate of their line. Year by year the
king grew more attached to his island heritage; and
through many sorrows and misfortunes, he clung to
it as a reminiscence of the past, and a safeguard for the
future. At length a powerful and ambitious neighbor
made war upon him, defeated him, and drove him to
take refuge upon this one small island, the last of his
possessions. As long as he could retain it he was
not without hope; but when this also was taken from
him, the unfortunate king wandered, exiled and
broken-hearted, in a foreign land, and at length returned
in disguise, old and friendless, to die upon
the ground consecrated to his race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Franzchen always entered with her whole heart
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
into every thing she related, however insignificant;
and she now described with great effect the loveliness
of the island, and the despair of the exiled
monarch. Her eyes beamed, and her voice rose as
she told of the conflict, and fell again into sadness,
as she spoke of the defeat, the exile, and the sad
return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Count Hugo moved nearer as she proceeded, and
looked at her with increasing interest and pleasure;
and Magda smiled, for she had often experienced
the living interest which Franzchen threw, like a
magic web, over all her recitals. Then she and
Count Hugo must also relate something; and though
they could not pretend to compete with Franzchen,
yet the eager interest she took in all that was said,
acted almost like inspiration; and the tales and traditions
went round, until Magda, startled by the lateness
of the hour, rose to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that the count liked nothing better than to
prevail upon Franzchen to draw upon her retentive
memory for the stories and anecdotes in which she
delighted; and then they would enter into airy and
mystical conversations, and such abstract philosophical
questions, that Magda declared she was fast
taking leave of her seven senses, and running the
risk of colds, chills, and all kinds of disasters, by
sitting upon the grass, and walking through the park
at all hours of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So passed the time for days and for weeks; for
Count Hugo prolonged his stay, and, indeed, he
seemed very unwilling to take his departure at all;
and the baroness, triumphant in the success of her
plans, would not hear of Magda’s leaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day Count Hugo walked out with them,
read to them, and seemed to take increasing interest
in their society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving Magda and the count alone, Franzchen
often found them engaged in earnest conversation,
when they would appear evidently embarrassed
by her return. Then the count would jump up,
offer her his seat, and enter at once into an animated
discussion upon the first subject that entered his
head. This Franzchen looked upon as a very natural
proceeding, and a matter of course. Sometimes it
struck her, that he talked too much to her, that he
paid her more attention, and consulted her wishes
even more than Magda’s; but that was only a little
awkwardness, and Magda was not of a jealous disposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length they came to the conclusion that the
visit to Franzchen’s good cousin could be postponed
no longer. So they reluctantly fixed upon the day
for their departure, and the baroness could not prevail
upon them to delay it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the last evening they went to take a farewell
walk in the park. Magda was silent and thoughtful,
Franzchen decidedly dismal, and Count Hugo seemed
uneasy and absent-minded. Franzchen at length,
to break the silence, doubled a large leaf into a cup,
and pretending to be very thirsty, dipped up water
from the river, and offered it to her companions,
under the pretence that it was the choicer nectar.
Count Hugo declared the river water was detestable,
begged her not to taste it, and said he would
bring her some from the spring. In vain she protested
that she would wait until she returned, that
she could not think of letting him go all the way back
to the spring. He was only too happy to be of any
service—and he darted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so we really must go to-morrow,” said
Franzchen, sadly, after standing a moment looking
after him. “What shall we do without Count
Hugo, Magda?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we need not part with him. He only waits
for permission to accompany us to-morrow to your
cousin’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he, indeed? Oh, Magda, surely you will
grant it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing to do with it, Franzchen. I shall
never exert any influence over him but that of a
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Magda, I always supposed—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Carl Engleford,” interrupted Magda, archly.
“What would become of poor Carl Engleford! And
now,” she said, speaking more seriously, “let me
assure you, dearest Franzchen, that I have never
for a moment thought of the count for myself. It is
for you I have sought his society; it is for your sake
I have prolonged our stay; and it is for your sake
alone that the count has remained with us. Forgive
me a little innocent deception. The baroness manœuvered
for me, and I must needs manœuvre a little
for you. Now the count has fairly engaged me on
his side. He loves you truly; and it has long been
my most earnest wish to see you look favorably
upon him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes!” cried Count Hugo, who at that moment
appeared among the trees, bearing a pitcher of
water, which he let fall hastily as he rushed forward
to seize her hand. “Loveliest Franzchen! have
you not long seen how I delight in your society,
and how miserable I should be without you! It is,
indeed, your permission I wait for! Will you not
grant it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magda quietly descended after the pitcher, which
had been rolling down the sloping ground in a most
perilous manner, while the count poured forth such
a torrent of persuasion and beseeching looks, that before
the bewildered little Franzchen well knew what
she was about, she had granted the desired permission,
and allowed him to cover her hand with kisses,
in gratitude therefor. But although she had consented
rather hastily, yet, on recovering her senses,
and considering the matter, she did not feel inclined
to retract; and her first thought on the following
morning was, “How glad I am Count Hugo is
going with us.”</p>

<hr class='tbk132'/>

<p class='pindent'>Great was the triumph of the baroness, when
she heard that the count was to accompany her
guests; but immense was her astonishment and
disappointment, when she discovered that it was as
the declared suitor, not of Magdalene, but of Franzchen;
and severe would have been the upbraidings
which her niece would have had to bear, for not acquainting
her sooner with the true state of things, had
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
not Count Hugo, before their departure, earnestly
thanked her for the great kindness and discretion
with which she had discerned his feelings, and aided
him in seeking the society of her young friends.
Whereupon, she thought it best to conceal her dissatisfaction,
under the pretence of great penetration.
And, after all she thought, Baron Logrum
is richer than the count, and evidently admires
Magda greatly; and so—and so—</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so ended the visit to Radgardin.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Death</span> was in the house; in the room; in the
small pallet where, side by side, lay the mother and
her newly born child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poverty was there, too, hard-featured and repulsive
always, but now hanging her head and hiding
her face before the stern reality of the dark angel.
What mattered it how the soul took its departure?
whether in state, with many mourning eyes gazing,
and white stoled priest with lifted hands at the bedside;
or desolate and wholly forsaken of man as
was Clara Neville’s on her straw-bed in her lonely
hovel? It mattered not—and yet may our last moments
be cheered by the silent and tearful love of
friends—as we start on our dark voyage, may we
hear the cheering tones and be buoyed up by the
affectionate throbs of the beloved hearts around us!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pestilence had come among the inmates of the
hamlet. They were not barbarians, else, to leave
the couch of death untended. But bereavement and
selfishness and mortal fear had done its work. The
few who remained were dying alone, and of this
number was Clara Neville and her young daughter.
Her husband in a distant land, her kindred estranged
or dead, she met her fast coming fate alone, but with
one all-absorbing anxiety. With that anxious will,
she had kept herself, as it were, alive—that she
might not leave her little one in the world behind
her. While the death-damps hung on her own brow,
her straining gaze yet rested on the form and face of
the pale infant, whose fluttering breath grew shorter
and shorter every instant. Still she clasped her baby
close to her poor heart, with the energy that death
itself could not subdue, and when at length the limbs
straightened in what the mother knew was the last
convulsion, Clara cast her eyes to heaven, and
closing her speechless lips, in a glad smile passed
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it seemed at least. But help was nighest when
it seemed farthest away. The door of the hovel
was flung open—the serene air poured in; gentle
hands ministered at the couch, and restoratives and
cordials on lip and brow brought back the life that
seemed to have left its dwelling. The disease had
reached its crisis, and the eyes of both mother and
child once more opened on the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara, weak and half insensible still from the
deadly illness she had suffered, scarcely looked at
the pure, white linen of her bed, the little comforts
and luxuries about her, or the gentle and watchful
Sister of Charity who bent over her, with the cool
draught or the nourishing mixture. She looked
only at the sleeping cherub at her bosom, without
power to smooth, as she longed to, the brown curls
on the forehead, or to kiss the gentle eyes in their
pleasant sleep. Then she, too, sunk into such a
sleep, long and refreshing, and hour after hour the
Sister sat by the bed, till the night passed and the
morning, and the sun came against the white curtain
at the head of the silent bed. Nature was kindly
dealing with Clara and her young baby; they slept
and gathered strength to live. Stronger and deeper
came the breath of both—more rapidly ran the rosy
current over the calm faces of both, till Nature,
drawing from her deep wells of love, moistened the
thirsty lip of one, at the moment the glad throb of
the other’s heart woke them both to happy existence.
Clara nursed her child and had no words to
express her joy. The watchful Sister saw the emotion
that pervaded her frame, and placing her finger
on her lip, prepared a composing draught for the
young mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many days passed of the kindest care and the most
rapid recovery. Both mother and child were so
well as no longer to need the constant aid of the
Sister. But she sat with Clara the evening before
her departure, her kind face lighted up with benevolence
and interest in those she had saved from
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Mary grant it may be best for both of you!”
ejaculated she, as her fingers mechanically sought
her rosary and moved rapidly over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” said Clara, piously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have tasted the bitterness of death once.
You can never dread it so much again. I have attended
many death-beds, I never saw any thing so
nearly like it as yours was; but for a little warmth
about the heart, I should have been quite discouraged;
and then when I tore open your vest the crucifix
lay there, and I was almost sure you were
living. Our Blessed Mother would be loth that the
pillow on which Jesus rested should be hard and
cold; and sure enough it was not half an hour before
your eyes opened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Sister Martha,” said Clara; “I had dreams
in that half hour which I shall never forget to the
last day of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me them if you may. The dreams of those
who have passed from death back to life, must be
foreshadowings and pictures of the life beyond. Holy
St. Ignatius had many such, when exhausted with
excessive fasts he lay in death-like swoons on the
floor of his cell. Tell me, then, I pray you, in what
form death came to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like two vast dark wings, which grew darker
and darker, and folded closer and closer over me,
till at last they seemed to brood over me, as I have
seen birds over their young. There was nothing
strange or gloomy about them—nothing frightful.
They seemed to have a right there, and I knew
what it was; only I could not look at or attend to its
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
approaches, because I waited and watched first for
the soul of my darling to pass. I said it with my
thought to the dark wings, and it replied—‘You shall
pass away together.’ Then it came closer to me,
like a watching mother to the bed, and I felt it come
down on my eyes like a shadow, and then I seemed
to sleep a long, long while. Such a sleep as one is
half conscious of, and the refreshment of which he
fully enjoys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I awoke, I found or felt myself in the
folds, as it were, of a cloud. It was rose-colored,
and seemed made of music—but the music was not
set harmony either, and seemed composed of all natural
soothing sounds. The whisper and rush of the
wave on the sea shore, the murmur of the brooklet,
or the sighing of the wind among the trees or over
the long grass; all sounds that are associated with
peace and loveliness filled and seemed to compose
this cloud, for there was a mingling of senses, so to
speak, or rather all that was most lovely in sound
and color and odor embathed and permeated my
being without my perceiving, far less analyzing, the
source of my pleasure. At length, as if the natural
body were changed for a spiritual one, I began to
ascend and descend on the pillowy clouds above and
about me, I moved voluntarily, and was conscious of
an independent existence. Slowly came back the
memory of life and of its relations. But though I
remembered my baby entirely, I was without that
agonizing anxiety for her with which I had died.
There were many soft female faces about me as I
lay there, and presently I felt that the Blessed Mother
herself was among them, for she leaned over
me and smiled; and then, I knew without her telling
me, that my own baby was the one she held in her
arms and gave to me. I cannot express to you the
home-feeling that this gave me. All about me grew
more soft and lovely, the forms and features of all
more and more distinct, as if they were careful not
to oppress the new-born soul with excess of
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when the rose-cloud floated away and the
clear blue beyond of the very heavens, sprinkled
with starry light, of which our firmament in a clear
wintry night gives you but a feeble idea, I felt then
the activity of a spirit. With the celerity of thought
we traversed, in bands or alone, the infinite space,
where we learned God in its beauty and vastness,
and learning Him, adored Him. It was but a beginning,
a moment of eternity that I had begun to taste,
yet what years I seemed to myself to live! Once
only I saw the Holy Jesus, and then He spoke so
gently the words, ‘A little while, and where I am,
you shall be also. Suffer your little one, also, to
come unto me, and forbid her not; she will remember
her first moments in heaven.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the next thing I remember was a dull,
sluggish feeling, of almost pain, and a choking sensation;
and then, your face, full of compassion, my
kind Sister, beamed on me and consoled me. It
had been a grievous change from heaven’s angels,
but that I found one of mercy on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very little like an angel,” said Sister Martha,
with a smile; “but tell me now, how the angels
look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just what I cannot do,” said Clara, “no
more than I can tell how the soul looks that beams
in your eye, but is not your eye,—how the tears
well up from your tender heart, and soften but do
not suffuse. Ah! with what body do they come?
Something that without seeing, we love, and before
which, body, and feature, and form, even in this life
melt away. Even here we love what we never
saw or can see, how much more in a world, where
thought meets thought with purest eloquence, unimpeded
by words or tones, where the glance of an
eye speaks a clear reply to every question you ask,
and gentle affections lapse your soul in perpetual joy.
You love them, these angels, without knowing why,
and without the need of sight to feed the feeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen very much, Clara,” said the pious
sister, “I would I might die, to learn thus, how to
live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, life can never seem to me as it has done. I
would that so it might have looked to my darling
child. I would that she might have the memory of
that fond embrace, and those touching words of the
Divine Saviour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sister Martha never forgot this incident in her monotonous
and yet ever varied existence. In the varieties
of pain and suffering which she witnessed
and relieved, she constantly remembered the young
Clara and her eventful entrance into a life which
promised so little to innocence and poverty. From
time to time she traced her path, and administered
such consolations and assistance as were consistent
with her own duties, and when ten years after, Mrs.
Neville sunk into a sleep of death, Sister Martha
closed the eyes of the parent, and bore the weeping
child to the convent of Chaillot, where she would
have at least a shelter, and the kind care she
needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since her birth, Clara, or as the Sisters of the
French Convent called her, Claire Neville, had
neither seen nor heard from her father, but her
mother, who had received no intelligence of his
death, had constantly looked forward, even to the
day of her death, to a re-union with him upon earth,
and not an hour before she died, she had told the beloved
being, for whom alone she wished to live,
that she was convinced that she should not depart,
without once more being consoled by his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments before her final departure, her
vivid fancy, acting on the hope that had so long
filled her whole being, produced the resemblance
for which she sighed. She raised her eyes to the
door, and a glad expression of recognition, illumined
them with more than mortal light; and while those
about her in vain sought for the object of her mental
sight, she was evidently in a state of happy conviction
that the so long-lost was found, and that her
child had, when most she needed it, found a friend
and a father. Her lips moved, but uttered no sound—she
gazed at her child, and smiled,—and, in that
smile, passed into a world, where is no more death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire remained at the convent, which was within
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
a mile of the small town of Chaillot, on the French
coast; and, by rendering such services as her tender
age would permit—and by her unvarying sweetness
and gentleness, endeared herself to the sisters, and as
they said, amply repaid them for the slight expenses
she incurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, deprived of the society of children, and having
no person about her, with whom she could precisely
sympathize, the young girl grew up with an isolation
of spirit, easy to foresee, and a prematurity of character,
consequent on her position, which strangely
contrasted with her childish face. Her eyes, which
were of a clear blue, had a sweet seriousness in
their depths, so far removed from the glad <span class='it'>insouciance</span>
of childhood, as to startle you as you gazed,
and for the moment to fill you with awe, as if in the
presence of a spirit—at least such was my own
feeling the first time I saw her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been ordered to the south of France for my
health, and had been stopping for a week in the
town, near which the convent of Chaillot was situated.
Its white walls could be easily seen through
the trees around it, and from its windows the far-reaching
sea suggested images of lonely and solemn
grandeur, in unison with the secluded character of
the pious inmates. From this institution, of all the
passive virtues, came forth alternately bands of those
heroic spirits, the Sisters of Mercy, who relinquishing
the life of quiet inaction, which the convent induced,
went with their hearty sympathy, their
cheerful aid, and their unshrinking labor, into every
abode where poverty, sickness, or even pestilence
cried out for a helping hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often a victim to this open-handed charity, this
sublime self-sacrifice would be brought home to the
convent, to breathe her last. But never was there a
gap in these heroic ranks. As fast as one brave
spirit fell, the place was filled by another, animated
by her example, and eager to take up her cross. It
was to this place, that the little Claire, taught by the
example of Sister Martha, looked forward as to the
fulfillment of her destiny. For this purpose, her
education had, at the early age of fourteen, fitted her
for a nurse; and in the convent she was called on,
in all the little cases of illness which needed a
soother. Nobody could spread a plaster so smoothly
as Claire—nobody could place a pillow so nicely
under the head as Claire—no one stepped so softly,
spoke so gently, bathed so coolly, as Claire—none
murmured so monotonously the rosary, or
sung in a low tone the Ave Maria, so as to bring
sleep on the strained eyelids, as Claire—and her
gentleness and assiduity had entirely won the hearts
of the good Sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, it was late in the afternoon, I had gone
down on the beach to walk, as my habit was,
for some hours. The character of the shore for
miles, which was exceedingly bold and rocky contrasted
with the smooth expanse and soothing murmurs
of the sea; and debarred by my want of
strength, from scaling the rocks, as I longed to do, I
used to wander on the white, hard sand, with a free
feeling of delight, and an animating glow, that was
second only to the sense of power with which the
strong, firm step of the mountaineer springs from
one cliff to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon I mention, this effervescence of
the blood, which induced a corresponding elevation
and sensitiveness to the spirit, kept me in a perpetual
state of enjoyment, which I did not attempt
to analyze, but was content to feel. The sun had set,
and the brilliant hues over the water continually
broke in little rainbows on the crested waves.
The air, balmy and fresh, was full of life. The
birds wheeled and circled in graceful joyousness
over the lapsing, and seemingly conscious ocean,
which swelled and whispered its mysterious replies.
For the first time I felt my own spirit in harmony
with nature in this aspect. Formerly, an undefinable
terror took possession of me at being left alone with
the ocean. It was the same with the sky. Many a
time I have glanced timidly at the depths of the sky,
and shrunk from it, as if it were from the presence
of the Creative Power; and always when the
whole breadth of the sea stretched out his leviathan
length before me, it awed and oppressed me to
such a degree that I did not like to walk alone on
the beach. Every wave, as it dashed up the smooth
“untrampled floor,” had come laden with sounds of
lamentation. I had continually thought, as I looked
at it, how deceitful it was, in its beauty, and how
its magnificence and pomp covered sorrowing,
and wrecks, and heart breakings. But now, for no
reason, all was different. The ocean seemed like a
great angel of God’s mercy, beautiful, vast, and conscious.
It married with the sky, and reflected all
hues of beauty and glory, and sang out songs of
praise to the Power that made them both. My
spirit rose and mingled with the simple majesty of
the scenery. I too felt myself a child of God, and
could understand and worship him. In my heart
were echoed the dim soundings of the sea; in
my thoughts sparkled the watching stars, and the
still lingering sun-beams. The transcendant beauty,
above all form, yet which reveled in creative
forms; the vastness and vague splendor of nature,
in this view, all spoke of the Infinite in my soul.
Deep called unto deep to praise Him, and I paced
hurriedly to and fro, with an excitement and elevation
of soul that rendered me insensible to the passage
of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water was already dark with the reflection
of night, when a light touch startled me, as if I had
received an electric shock. I looked up and saw a
sweet, serious figure at my side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame is not aware that the evening is chill,”
said she, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chilly is it?” I answered. “It seems very
warm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been walking a long time—hours.
Will Madame permit me to go home with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mingled the formal politeness of a stranger
with the familiar <span class='it'>tu</span> that seemed induced by kindness
and anxiety. I felt the feverish glow on my
cheek, and replied, “that I had probably walked
beyond my strength.” Already the re-action of
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
lassitude and weakness crept over me, and I could
hardly walk, as we turned toward the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is half a mile to the village. You are very
weak. Permit me to attend you to the convent
near. It wilt be no inconvenience. Lean on me,
dear Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke these words calmly and slowly, but, as
if she were to be obeyed. I followed her mechanically,
or rather tottered along by her side without
question. I felt too much exhausted to talk, and
also the need of immediate repose and care in my
wearied condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes walk brought us to the convent
gate. An old man, who was also the gardener,
opened it, and two of the sisters hurried to the door
to receive us. A slight gesture from my guide, produced
profound silence, and I was at once taken to a
room and a bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I awoke from an unconscious state, produced I
supposed by the sedative I had drank immediately
on my arrival, and looked languidly around me. I
remember my first feeling was one of surprise at
the comfortable appearance of every thing near and
about me. I had never been in a convent before,
and had supposed, with the vague notions of Protestantism
about convents, that I should be put in a
cell at least, with probably a death’s head and cross-bones
for furniture, and a hair-cloth and thongs for
entertainment. On the contrary, I felt myself lying
on a down-bed—muslin curtains gathered in delicate
folds above it—the windows shaded with the same
material—waving lightly to and fro in the summer
night air. The oaken floor so highly polished, and
the neat table holding a nurse-lamp and some phials.
Besides that, there was no look of a sick-room.
The lamp shone on the mild face of the Madonna of
Sassoferato, whose clasped hands and conventual
garb seemed to make her the tutelar genius of such
a scene; and below, was the never-failing crucifix of
ivory on a bronze stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a sound, but the sighing of the leaves against
the window, interrupted the midnight quiet of the
scene. Refreshed and composed by the judicious
treatment I had received, I lay calmly recalling the
preceding evening, and wondering what my landlady
at the village would think of my being out all
night. I might have spared any anxiety on that account,
as I afterward learned, as the good Sisters
had at once dispatched a messenger to assure her of
my safety. In that small place the arrival of a
stranger is an event. The seclusion of a convent is
favorable to curiosity, and my name, situation,
health, and person, were perfectly well-known to
all the good Sisters, though I had not chanced to meet
one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A distant strain of music broke the silence around
me. I started, and raising myself in bed undrew
the curtains. A figure clothed in white approached
the bed, and I recognized at once the face of my yesterday’s
companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be startled. It is only the Sisters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent her sweet face over me, like an angel
watcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been sitting by me all night, my dear,”
said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! that is nothing,” she answered, cheerfully.
“I like to keep awake in the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what can you have to occupy yourself with?
Surely, you cannot be satisfied with telling your
beads over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have my netting by me, and then there are
always one’s thoughts and memories.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your memories, my dear,” said I, “what
are they? What can you remember that is not
so mingled with pain and deprivations, that the
contemplation of it must be sad rather than pleasant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reply, she told me in her own simple and
touching manner the story of her mother’s death,
and the almost revelation that preceded it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how do you feel about it yourself?”
said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fully believe, madam, that such an impression
would not have been vouchsafed by the good God to
my mother, unless it had been true, and important
also that I should know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you still look for your father, my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I look for the sunrise to-morrow,” she answered,
raising her clear eyes to heaven. “Some
day he will certainly come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And meanwhile!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile, I think of him continually. I imagine
always how he would like to have me conduct
myself, and in all my little troubles I look forward
to the time when I shall feel no more sorrow. You
will not think me superstitious, madam, when I tell
you that my mother’s heart is very near to mine, and
often I am conscious of heavenly thoughts that I am
sure are of her whispering to my spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would not for the world have disturbed fancies
so sweet and holy as filled the breast of this lovely
child with any doubts of their reality, even if I had
not been more than half inclined to agree with her
in the belief of spiritual intercourse with the departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Claire,” said I, after a long pause, “it is a
strange and terrible thought, one at which we instinctively
revolt, that close to us, by night or by day,
is a haunting spirit, even if it were our mother’s.
It seems to me I should so dread the answer,
that I could never gather courage to speak to such
a spirit, if I believed it could and would answer
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it would not answer. Ah! if it could
do so, would it not long since have responded to the
agonized cry of the bereaved! But, though it is not
to sense that it speaks, the impression is not the less
vivid or credible. It is not what you see with your
mortal eye, dear lady, that you believe most fully
and heartily. Even if we were to see the beloved
form or hear the beloved tones, a something would
whisper to us of doubt and incredulity. It would be
‘an optical illusion,’ or ‘a derangement of the auricular
organs,’ and we should very soon come to
believe ourselves entirely mistaken in the impressions
we had received. It is only the mind itself
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
that can take distinct cognizance of its own objects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak like a philosopher, dear Claire.
Where have you learned to consider the subject so
deeply?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of Father Angelo,” replied the young girl,
simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he is your confessor, I suppose,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam; and my best friend. For dear
Sister Martha, who has told me of my early life,
could not resolve my doubts and fears, and the thousand
anxieties that I should naturally feel, and I have
been both relieved and enlightened by free conversation
with Father Angelo. He must have suffered
much himself, for his heart is so tender and his manner
so soothing, and yet he always strengthens one’s
spirit so much, with his calm views of another life,
in this life of ours. Till he came to us I never knew
fully what sympathy was. The Sisters but half understood
me, and when I saw the excellence of their
lives, when I watched their hardy activity and their
daily devotion to duty, I used to feel sure that theirs
must be the true thought that led directly to right
action, and that my world of fancies and mysteries
must be a morbid and unhealthy one. Still I felt
constantly that ‘I heard a voice they could not
hear,’ and never till last summer, when Father
Angelo came to us, did I at all understand myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now that you do understand yourself, you
are happy, my child?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As happy as one with unoccupied affections can
be, madam. I feel that I have much love that has
never been called into action, and I fancy that my
father when he comes will fill my heart. Meantime,
I see why it is that there are depths in my
soul that no plummet can sound, and where the
voice of God alone calls forth an answer. Sometime
or other, either in this world or a future one,
these deep voices will find musical utterance, and
the harmony of the affections, which alone is wanting
to the harmony of nature, will make my being
what God intended it to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are happy, my dear child, to have such a
confidence; it comes sometimes after suffering and
sorrowful experiences, but seldom in the bloom of
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I should have wandered long and unhappily
but for the guidance of Father Angelo,” said
Claire, her eyes radiant with grateful affection
whenever she spoke of this father of her best
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I became curious to see Father Angelo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will he come here again?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow at furthest,” said Claire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I hope I shall see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly, if madam desires it,” said Claire,
with a pleased look. “But apparently, madam is a
Protestant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do not want to confess to him,” said I,
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, madam. But have you never felt
that it would be a great pleasure and privilege to
confess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly not, Claire,” said I, more seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam has had dear friends then, to whom she
could express every thought—confess every fault—and
to whom she could apply in every difficulty?”
inquired she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—not always,” answered I, hesitatingly;
“but, Claire, we believe that to God alone we should
confess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God alone can absolve,” said Claire, devoutly,
“by the mouth of his minister, the repenting heart.
But there are so many things we wish to say to an
earthly friend, and to which we must receive an answer—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we believe the Bible to be a sufficient guide
to all our darkness and doubts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morally I know it is, madam. And I do not
say that its precepts will not reach every variety of
intellectual difficulty. But I have found that conference
with a superior mind is a great relief and
pleasure, as well as guide, in understanding the
doubts that often weigh on the mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unquestionably it is so, Claire; but we find
those superior minds in the circle of our acquaintances,
in our husbands, brothers, and the friends to
whom we attach ourselves. We have not the need
of confession that you feel, isolated as you are from
any guiding mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam, that is true. I can see that in
such a case confession would not be so necessary;
but with us it is a great need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew the curtains as she spoke, and sat silently
at her netting. I lay revolving in my mind
for a long time the conversation I had been holding
with this strange girl. There was something in the
maturity of her mind and the dignity of her manner,
that contrasted greatly with the extreme youthfulness
of her figure and face. Her eyes had a quiet
serenity that seemed the result of having attained, at
a bound, the goal to which humanity generally
reaches after long and painful experiences and mental
vicissitudes that leave their unmistakable marks
on the face. But in Claire’s face, seen by the pale
light of the room, was an angelic wisdom, pure and
high. Yet she did not look satisfied; or rather, she
was satisfied only in the thought of a future different
from the calm present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked myself how would this sweet flower bear
transplanting? She had no ties but those of gratitude
to the place she was in, and as a sphere of usefulness,
some one more strong and hardy could fill
it better than she did. She evidently looked and
longed for the arrival of her father, more from “the
necessity of loving” than from a filial feeling. I did
not myself believe that he was in existence, or that
if he were, he was worthy of her affection, or he
would long ere this have sought her out. Thoughts
like these kept me wakeful, and when I undrew the
curtain again to speak to Claire, I found she had
gone softly out, and her place was supplied by a stout
“Sister,” to whom I had no inclination to speak.
She told me, in answer to my query, that day was
nearly breaking, and I sunk to sleep in the hearing
of the distant music of the morning-hymn.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
The sun was already high in the heavens when I
awoke. Claire was sitting by the side of my bed,
and at my first motion, spoke to me with a cheerful
smile that well corresponded with the serene brightness
of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Angelo has been here for some time,
madam; I have been telling him about you, for truly,
madam, I feel as if I had known you a long time,
instead of only one night. He will be glad to see
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall like to see him, Claire. But as I
feel myself, thanks to your kindness, quite recovered,
I will not receive him so entirely in dishabille.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few momenta I was dressed, and walking in
the small garden attached to the convent. Claire
left me for a short time, and then came out followed
or rather attended by her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was dressed in the common black robe of his
order, with the cowl thrown back so as fully to display
his head and throat. For the first time, I understood
that he was not a monk, but only a clergyman,
as we should say. A priest, and not a very
old one either. Certainly he had never numbered
more than thirty-five years. His face was entirely
pale, and his temples covered with dark hair, while
his red lips and white, even teeth had the grace of
feminine contour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was struck with the gravity, even to sadness, of
his manner, no less than with the beauty of his person.
He uttered in a low, quiet voice the usual
benediction, and then asked me to listen to him, as
he had much to say to me. I replied with some surprise,
that I was quite at his service, and leading me
to a rude garden-seat, over which honeysuckles and
roses made a natural bower, he said quietly to
Claire—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will leave us, Claire, for half an hour; and
send Sister Mary with some of her coffee and best
buns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not precisely the confessional I had anticipated;
and in spite of the little flutter of my
spirits, this picture of myself, in high colloquy with
a Catholic priest, sipping hot coffee and eating
nice buns, was so laughable, that I could hardly keep
my face in a state of suitable gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sister Mary’s white buns and fragrant coffee were
delicious indeed. While I partook of them, Father
Angelo leaned his head on his hand in profound abstraction.
His complete absorption continued for
some minutes after the nun had left us alone. At
length he raised his head, and looking steadily at me,
said abruptly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it is vain to attempt any thing like a
conversion of your principles to the true church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Entirely so,” I answered, “as I was born and
educated I shall probably remain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there was a long silence. What it was to
end in, I could not guess; but I determined not to
break it. My companion was evidently agitated and
uncomfortable. His red lips became pale and quivering,
and his brow bent. He rose from his seat, and
paced back and forward on the graveled walk. After
some time had elapsed in this inward conflict, he
seated himself once more by my side, and taking my
hand, addressed me thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me for saying that I require from you a
solemn promise of secrecy in regard to what I am
about to communicate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was somewhat prepared for a communication, it
is true; but not at all disposed to bind myself to
secrecy with a stranger. He seemed to read my
thoughts, for he fixed his bright eyes on mine, and
then dropped them with an expression of embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should not have asked you, madam, for this
pledge of secrecy, but that it is of much importance—and—and
I think you can receive no inconvenience—possibly—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped entirely, but again raised his eyes
with an expression so imploring, that I said at
once,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say on, sir. I promise you that nothing but the
most imperative necessity shall make me disclose to
any one what you may tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said he, eagerly; “it is not on my
account that I desire secrecy. But there are many
reasons—the good of the church—evil tongues.
When I have told you all, these reasons will readily
suggest themselves to your own mind. You are
surprised that I should choose to make an entire
stranger my confident in a secret. But in the first
place, you are not entirely unknown to me. I have
interested myself in you somewhat; and there have
been persons enough ready to tell me of your ‘birth,
parentage, and education.’ Of your mind and heart,
Claire has told me much this morning, in a long conversation
we have had; and, in short, circumstances
make it necessary that I should confide in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something so heartfelt in the tone in
which Father Angelo spoke, something so entirely
sincere, notwithstanding the mystery in which the
affair was enveloped, that I repeated what I had before
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever you wish to say to me, sir, I am ready
to hear, to keep entirely to myself, and to assist you
to the best of my power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked greatly relieved, and proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have divined, before this, madam, the reason
of my wish to confide in you. You are a foreigner,
a Protestant, a widow, and independent in your actions.
Claire needs all these for her friend and efficient
adviser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Claire! then it is of her you wish to speak? I
supposed your secret concerned yourself. She has
told me of her own life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has told you what she knew,” said Father
Angelo, with the same abruptness as before. Indeed,
through the whole of our interview, there was an
earnestness which dispensed with the usual forms
almost of civility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been waiting, watching for such an event
as your coming, ever since last year, when I first became
fully acquainted with Claire, and saw how unsuited
she was to a conventual life. She has warm
feelings and superior intellect, and she is fretted continually
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
by the discrepancy between her inward and
outward life. She would be a companion to you,
and—she has some means—” he stopped, and a slight
flush passed over his pale face. “I should not wish
her to be a dependent on the bounty of any person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand, however, from Claire herself,”
said I, “that her mother died poor, and that she has
been indebted to charity for her support. This father
of hers—if he be living—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think he must be a wretch,” said Father
Angelo, calmly, “so to desert those who have every
claim on his care. Be it so. He is a wretch. And
most wretched is he, that, seeing before him the
form of his child, and listening to the outpourings of
her angelic soul, he should be barred from acknowledging
kindred with it, and forced, for the very love
he bears her, to tear her from him forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will accede to my earnest request, take
Claire with you to America—care for her—watch
over her—be to her all that, alas! her father must
not be—and I shall feel that all, and a thousand times
more than all I deserve, and all I live for, is granted,
and shall at once enter a convent of La Trappe. I
long for it—I long for eternal silence; and have only
retained my present position, that I might find Claire,
read her character, and do what I could to unfold and
strengthen it. That mission is accomplished. Her
native strength of wing has already carried her mind
beyond what my feeble flights can follow. She soars
to regions of purity and peace, where my soul cannot
revel, unless after long years of penance and suffering.
She loves the ideal parent, who is to her the
personification of all virtue; and it is impossible, and
ought to be so, for me to sully her thoughts with the
reality which to her must always be a source of disappointment
and mortification, and to me inexpressible
shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This revelation was not unexpected to me, so far
as regarded the relationship of the two parties; but
it filled me with much matter for meditation. I had no
curiosity to know the events of Father Angelo’s past
life. The lines of suffering, and the traces of strong
passions, were marked deeply on his marble brow,
and composed even to severity as his manner now
was, I could read under the habitual restraint of his
expressive face, that no slight agony had wrought on
a naturally proud and sensitive spirit, before it could
compel itself to forego its sweetest pleasures rather
than breathe on the purity of the beloved object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some time passed on my side in revolving
what I had heard, and what I was expected to do,
and on his, in a distressful silence that watched painfully
for my first word, I asked,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But about Claire’s religious influences. She
will have few of the kind she has been accustomed
to; and all her indirect influences, you must be aware,
will not be very favorable to her religious constancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she will become a Protestant. You are
surprised that I should be willing to trust her in
such an atmosphere. But there are some minds that
are cast, so to speak, in a Protestant mould; and
hers is one. She has not a great deal of faith, and
her mind naturally tends so much to inquiry, perhaps
I should say skepticism, that I found it difficult
to lead her. I may as well say at once, that my
own reasons for adopting the profession and character
of a priest, were first to discover her, and know her
mind more intimately than I could do in any other
position; and secondly, because the Catholic faith
promises more to me than any other religion. I feel
the need of what it has to give; but to Claire, I can
see its spirit and forms are not so necessary. I am
not bigoted nor intolerant, as you see. Perhaps I
am not a good Catholic. But I wish you to understand
that I am not acting against my conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are strange words from a Catholic priest,”
said I, looking at him. A flush of impatience crossed
his face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need not qualify my words to you, I am sure.
What I need—a wretched, debased sinner—stripes—fasting—silence—and
digging my own grave daily—are
not the necessary aliment of Claire’s soul, fresh
from the forming hand of the All-Pure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I understand that Claire, if I take her, is to
be like my own child; that no interference of any
kind with my authority or influence is to be allowed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no person living authorized to interfere,”
said Father Angelo, sadly. “Her father will
be dead to her. And God will reward or punish
you as you deal by this forlorn and most angelic
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I accept the trust,” said I, with the same solemnity
that was expressed in the manner of the unhappy
father. He took my hand in his, and holding
it up, repeated a short prayer in Latin, which I took
to be an invocation, but I said nothing; and, indeed,
was so agitated and exhausted that I could not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall leave this place this morning,” said he,
with a more composed voice, “and shall send to you
such information as may be necessary to her future
welfare in any possible contingency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rung a bell which stood on the table, and
Claire came into the garden, as if she had been in
waiting. He made a sign to her to attend to me,
and as soon as I had taken the restorative she hastened
to offer, rose to go. I shall never forget the
look of anguished affection that spread over his pale
face, as he murmured above Claire’s bright head the
customary benediction. His whole being seemed
one thrill of pain. Stooping over he pressed on her
forehead a kiss of such love! and then without another
word hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire looked astonished, as well she might, for
she had never seen him agitated before, though, as
she said, she conjectured he must have suffered
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He feels sorrowfully at leaving you, my child,”
said I, “he tells me he is about leaving this part of
the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me, as if she wondered at his communicating
such an intention to me, rather than to
herself, but was too delicate to inquire further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same afternoon a package came to the convent,
directed to me, and contained, among other
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
things, a letter from Father Angelo “to his beloved
daughter in Christ Jesus”—in which he recommended
her to accept the proposal I had made of
taking her with me to America, and containing besides
some affectionate words of advice. It was
brief, and I could easily see that many feelings had
prevented his being more prolix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I then entered more fully into the subject with
Claire, of her leaving her native country for mine.
I found, to my great joy, that she was not only willing
but desirous to go with me, and that a night’s
free converse with me had given me much of her
affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not dared to think, dear madam,” she
said tearfully, “how ‘doubly lone’ I should be when
you were gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think you shall not long for the seclusion
of Chaillot, and the hymns of the Sisters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I dare say I shall long to see them. But
meanwhile I do so long to be with you, and to see
something and somebody in the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will be my own daughter?” I asked
her now more seriously—“do you know how much
that implies? If I give you all I shall require
much from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not more than all my heart,” answered she
gayly, “and that you shall certainly have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Till somebody else asks for it,” said I to myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of my stay at Chaillot was cheered
by the occasional visits of Claire, but the most of the
time she spent at the convent, and among the poor
of the village, who loved her and mourned her departure.
When at last the vessel bore us both away
from France she was deeply affected. I was glad to
see it: glad that mere curiosity and interest in
novelty had not dulled her heart to one sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arrived at Boston, we met the kind faces of
friends, how kind and how dear, we never feel till
an ocean has separated us, and soon found ourselves
quietly established at my own residence, as if not a
week had passed since I was last there. Claire
gained in a northern climate all she needed to make
her perfect—strength of body, and consequent
strength of mind. She was never weary of the bold
natural scenery in which New England abounds,
and wandered and climbed till I used to beg her to
take care of herself for my sake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this time I had a plot in my head. For what
woman was ever without one? Had I not a son,
whose image was seldom absent an hour from my
memory, yet whose name I was careful not to mention
to Claire? Who could tell what might be in
the future, if I did not mar its brightness by my own
interference? So I patiently waited the result of
accidental influences. I expected Herbert home by
the next packet. He had been prevented from meeting
me in France, and accompanying us home, by
illness, and I had availed myself of the escort of some
friends who were coming to America, without waiting
for his recovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had been returned for more than two months.
The autumnal tints already brightened with consumptive
red the rich verdure of summer, and the
harvest-moon shone out with a calm brilliancy that
almost mocked the daily sun. Claire was delighted
with Nature under its bold American features. As
I watched the daily development of her taste, and
delighted to see its refinement and richness, I felt
that I could not have desired more in a daughter,
than was thrown as it were by the bounty of Providence
into my lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had been sitting in the old portico, with shawls
wrapt about us, and watching the moonlight on the
clumps of trees, as it silvered and sprinkled them
with heavenly glory, and neither of us had for a long
time spoken. Claire, who connected all still, solemn
beauty with the thought of her lost mother, was, I
doubted not, thinking of heaven and her; and I was
myself recalling my short and eventful acquaintance
with her father. Claire rose from her seat, and
walked down the avenue a short distance, then
turned and stood by a fountain, which played by the
side of a larch tree. It was a pretty picture. The
fountain, the tree, and the moon, that embathed the
girl, the fountain, and the tree in soft splendor.
Claire had removed her shawl from her shoulders,
and stood with it dropping off her arm, as motionless
as a statue. Her bright, waving hair lay over her
shoulders—and like the spirit of the scene she stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I, too, followed down the walk, I was conscious
of a second figure, which, as I approached,
came out from the shadow of a tree. Once in the
light, I recognized Herbert, and did <span class='it'>not</span> scream.
Neither did I beckon to him to look at, and fall in
love with, the beautiful being before us, because I
felt very certain that if it were to be done, there could
not be a better time for him to do it without my aid.
And with a self-command, which I believe is rare
among match-makers, I beckoned to him to retire to
the house, while I went forward to Claire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still motionless, absorbed in thoughts of
a not painful character, as was evident from the
placid expression of her lifted eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will take cold, Claire,” said I, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she answered, in her sweet French
accent, “I am not afraid. You know I am used to
all hours and weathers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am going in now. My son has arrived.
You have never heard me speak of him, I believe—but
I have felt considerable anxiety about him. An
anxiety which is now happily relieved by his
arrival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked a little surprised, but made no inquiry
and followed me into the house. I was curious to
see the effect of this her first acquaintance with
an accomplished and eminently attractive man.
Hitherto she had seen no person above the common
peasantry of the small town of Chaillot, except
Father Angelo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks after this evening, Herbert came into
my room, whence Claire had just gone to take a
walk, and throwing himself into a chair, wiped the
wet from his forehead and hair in a state of unquestionable
agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, mother! help me—help me, or I sink!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, really overcome? You, the redoubtable!
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
the renowned! the invincible! Can I believe my
eyes!” answered I, laughing heartily—for love-sickness,
like sea-sickness, gets no sympathy—and
I was really pleased to see Herbert, for once, undoubtedly
in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, a truce to your satire, mother mine. And
a truce to your smiles even. I wont allow that there
is any occasion for grief either; but the fact is, I
cannot live, now, without Claire and her love—and
she knows it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knows it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” said Herbert, impatiently; “and that’s
the devil of it! While I was endeavoring to wind
myself softly, soothingly, you see, into her tender
heart, not to break it, you know, but just to set all
its faculties and springs fluttering, like pigeons, and
to watch how she should blush, and sigh, and droop—till,
just at the right point, I meant, when she least
hoped and expected it, when she should despairingly
throw herself down, half senseless with excitement
and hopelessness—then, I meant to have stepped in.
Now, mother, don’t <span class='it'>say</span>, What an insufferable
puppy! for I feel it enough, I assure you. The fact
is, I didn’t know myself what I did mean till half an
hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible! Why, Claire has been reading to
me nearly or quite half an hour, and has just gone
out to carry some comfort to old Nurse Dobbins.
No appearance of maiden agitation about her, my
poor son, but as calm as a clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact was, I had noticed that her cheek had a
slight pallor, and had recommended the walk myself;
but this I did not think it necessary to mention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless!” was the pettish reply. “I wonder
if she is not all ice—or rather, whether she has a
heart for any thing but old women!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She certainly has a heart, and one well worth
the winning, Herbert. But not in the fashion you
have been used to. All-conquering knight that you
are—you must lay down your tinsel and frippery, and
don the helmet of sterling gold, and break a lance for
honor bright, if you would win favor from this child
of nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t she, mother?” said Herbert, enthusiastically,
“isn’t she the noblest, and loveliest, and
sweetest creature that ever the earth presumed to
bear up? You love her, I know; teach me how to
love her, so that she may love me! for it is true what
I tell you. I cannot live without her pure and beautiful
heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had never seen Herbert thoroughly moved before.
Under an exterior of frivolity he concealed
the real fervor and enthusiasm of which I knew him
capable. But it had been long since I had seen him
at all excited about any thing. That Claire should
interest him, was only allowing him a pure natural
taste; but that Claire should not have reciprocated
the sentiment she excited, puzzled me, I allow—for
I was a parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, mother,” he continued—or would have
done so, but that Claire just at that moment entered
the room, with her basket on her arm. Her pale
cheek now flushed with a rapid walk, was brilliant
with health, and her eyes met both Herbert’s and
mine with a buoyancy and serenity, as little like a
love-stricken girl as could well be imagined. I saw
Herbert’s cheek turn pale, as he suddenly rose and
springing through the window upon the lawn,
whistled to his dog, and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire looked after him, and then meeting my inquiring
eye, she stood with hers looking clearly into
my face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so my poor Herbert has no chance?” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seated herself by me with a little embarrassment,
which became her a thousand times more than
the serene self-possession so habitual to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My beloved mother—my benefactress!” she
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word of that, Claire. Hearts are to be
given, and not bought. But how comes it that you
see nothing lovable or winning about Herbert? He
seems perfectly hopeless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have seen, indeed I did see, a thousand
charming qualities in Mr. ——,” said Claire, with
grave simplicity, “but that he seemed to be only
amusing himself with me, and not in earnest about
any thing. Least of all did I believe him in earnest
when he professed love for me. Love! which I
have always looked on as something so holy, so
sacred, so ennobling! a trust so solemn as another’s
heart, not to be taken without awe and trembling!
Believe me, dearest mother, I did not once think,
nor can I now, that Mr. —— had an earnest thought
in the whole matter. Evidently he has only been
amusing himself, and trying perhaps to amuse me
with the idea of having made a conquest. He mistook
me altogether.” She drew her head up a very
little, with an expression that spoke of wounded
pride; but instantly dismissed it, and resumed her
usual affectionate look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will not think any more about it, dear
Claire. These things are best dismissed from the
thoughts. Shall we go on with our reading?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke hurriedly, for, in truth, I was severely disappointed.
I did not think how much so, until I
listened to the calm, decided tone, and looked on the
quiet face of Claire. Things looked hopeless for
Herbert; and I could not help sympathizing with
him in his keen disappointment. Meantime, as I
knew affection could not be reproached into existence,
I endeavored to divert both my own mind and
hers from a painful subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Absence is said to be the death of love, I believe
it is sometimes the birth of it. Certainly, Herbert,
if he had tried a thousand ways to Claire’s heart,
could not have hit on a likelier road than that which
led him away from her, under the pretence of going
to Niagara Falls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My body will go in search of the picturesque,
mother,” said he, with a faint attempt at gayety,
“but my soul remains at home. It will haunt you—both;
and I charge you listen to its whispers that
shall be in your ears night and day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell, Claire!” was all he said to her; and
when he was gone, she sat for some minutes, looking
into the heart of a flower she was holding in her
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
hand, as if trying to solve a problem too difficult
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Days passed, and weeks. We talked, and walked,
and rode, and read by turns, as we were wont to do,
before this vision of Herbert had passed over and
breathed on the mirror of her pure heart. But no
longer was her eye clear, and her brow serene. She
was disturbed and restless. An enemy had come in
to her heart to steal away its peace. When we read
poetry, a consciousness in her voice, gave meaning
and depth to every passionate tone; and when we
walked in the November woods, their melancholy
beauty woke sad feelings kindred to the scene. I
saw that her sensitive nature was touched to its
depths. She had begun to think, not that she was
loved, for her standard of that passion was too high
to leave her in such an error; but how sweet it would
be to be loved. Her heart, like a lonely harp-string,
vibrated in every breeze, and seemed asking vainly
for its completing harmony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not ask me to read to her any of Herbert’s
letters. I wished she would, and once read to her
what I thought a very capital description of the
cataract. But she only said composedly that my son
had described the scenery, and not his own impressions
on seeing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe any reality on earth could equal
the descriptions we have had of Niagara. It would
need heaven and hell almost to body forth the ideas
that travelers have called up. I can only hope to be
able, if ever I see it, to forget all that I have ever
heard about it, so as to shrink before its magnificence
as I should feel bound to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we try, Claire?” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all my heart,” answered she, evidently
glad in her restless state to be going somewhere. I
had previously told her that Herbert had gone to
Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a week’s time Claire and myself, with a man-servant,
had reached Albany, and there took the
canal-boats to Buffalo. The wearisome journey by
stage-coach had admirably prepared us for the monotonous
ease of the boat. Fortunately there were
very few passengers, and we lay in our little clean
white berths and rested and read as quietly as if we
had been in our own rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the Falls we were too thoroughly
wearied to attempt more that night, and went to our
beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On our way, a fellow passenger, experienced in
sight-seeing, had recommended to us to take our
first view from the American side, and from below,
instead of the usual view from Table Rock. We
therefore crossed the river a little distance below
the Falls, without giving way to the temptation of
gazing for a moment at the view before us, though
the roar was terrible in our ears. Then we walked
on the American side, closer, closer till we were
within twenty feet of the cataract. The spray dripped
over us, the rocks were slippery to our feet, the
roar of a thousand floods seemed in our bewildered
ears; and below, as it were, the reverberating yells
of damned spirits tossing, and whirling, and dashing
and howling forever. Then we looked up. The
volume of water seemed coming down from the
very heavens upon us. We uttered a faint cry of
terror—turned round and fled. That is to say, we
fled several yards. No matter. We were impressed
sufficiently with the physical grandeur of the scene.
It was oppressive, overwhelming. Afterward, when
we roamed over all these rocks and took views
from every point, and gazed at the cataract’s wondrous
beauty as well as power, we found a moral
grandeur with which our souls sympathized, and to
which they rose to enjoy and adore. These jottings
down of our impressions can give no idea to one who
has not visited the Falls, and to one who has, will
scarcely enhance his recollections. I mention them
only to illustrate a trait of Claire’s character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mother with her child were wandering along
among the loose stones and sharp rocks close to the
terrible whirlpool from which we had just turned.
The mother had let go the child’s hand, and he, a
lad of some four or five years old, slipped from the
stone on which he stood, and as a natural consequence
was in imminent danger of his life. But one
rock, and that slippery and sloping, intervened between
the little fellow and certain death. The mother
screamed, but was motionless from mere horror;
Claire, who at once forgot every thing about her but
what was connected with the living drama before
her, pulled at a stroke her scarf from her neck, and
giving me one end to hold, while she held the other,
slid her feet rapidly down to the very brink of the
torrent, caught the boy firmly by his foot and stood
holding him. She was as pale as death, but as firm
and strong in her attitude as if she stood on the parlor
floor. She dared not move, and I had not strength,
and was too distrustful of the strength of the scarf,
to dare to pull them up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we stood thus it seemed hours, though it could
scarcely be half a minute before relief was obtained
by a rope thrown by a strong arm from behind over
the form of Claire, which fully supported her in her
perilous position. Immediately after she was clasped
in the arms of a man in a cloak, whom we had seen
sitting near us in an absorbed attitude, seemingly
regardless of all about him. He had sprung from
his seat, caught up a boat-rope, which I perfectly
remembered afterward to have stepped over, thrown
it around Claire, so as to support her, and then giving
the noose to my servant, who stood close but inactively
behind, steadied himself by the other end of
the rope, slipped and sprang down by Claire, caught
up the boy with one hand and tossed him up to his
mother, and then bore the now fainting Claire carefully
up to the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy screamed wildly with fright, and the mother
was voluble with her thanks and offers of
assistance. Claire remained still and motionless in
the arms of the stranger, and I watched the spray
dash over her marble face. Presently her eyes
opened slowly, with a deep sigh. She looked at
her preserver and a beautiful color overspread her
face. Then for the first time I also looked at him,
for to this moment no one had spoken but the woman
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
whose carelessness had put in jeopardy three
lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had bent his head down to hers and had kissed
her forehead, rosy with returned consciousness. She
replied by pulling her arm over his neck and kissing,
not his forehead, but his very lips. The woman
and her boy had gone, the servant discreetly retired,
and there in the sound and rush of many waters, in
the turmoil of elemental war, the still, small voice
of two loving hearts, lately so near to death, was
heard and registered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you wrote me, Herbert, that you were setting
off for Quebec last week. Who could have
dreamed of finding you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so I did go to Quebec. But I used it up in
two days, and then came on here once more. In
my then state of mind it was a relief to place myself
where you found me, and listen to the roar of the
water from morning till night. Now, I don’t care
how soon we go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did journey, however, for some weeks; and
when we returned and were once more in our own
quiet parlor at home, I asked Herbert to come with
me to my room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to read you something, Herbert.
Something about Claire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I opened the packet which Father Angelo
had given me. First there was the official announcement,
or rather a copy of it, of Father Angelo’s admission
to the Convent of la Trappe, in Piedmont,
and his consequent death to the world and every
body in it. Then a separate packet contained such
particulars of his life as he deemed necessary for me
to know, and to communicate to Claire, if I thought
proper, or to whomsoever she should hereafter
marry. There were also papers conveying a small
amount of property to her. Enough for her subsistence
should she be deprived by misfortune of my
support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man had been sinned against and was also a
great sinner. He had sinned against the young English
girl, Clara, whom he had seduced from her
home under the false pretence of marriage, and
whose fidelity to him and trust in him had continued
to her gentle death. Afterward to win for himself
the means of keeping up his dissipated habits he had
recourse to forgery, and had escaped in disguise,
and narrowly, with his life. After that he went to
Rome; by a run of luck in gambling he obtained the
means of making a handsome appearance in society
there, and by his cultivation, taste and fine manners,
so impressed an Italian family of some distinction
that he married one of the daughters. The marriage
was an unhappy one. His wife eloped with his
friend, and the old drama of a duel was acted over.
Finally his resources were exhausted, and either
reason or conscience suggested to him the claim
which a wife and child had on his memory. At all
events, he became an altered man, took holy orders,
obtained permission to travel, and did travel in
search of his long-forgotten wife and child. After a
long search he found Claire. He sought her society.
He became her confessor and her friend. He
learned her pure heart, and her enthusiastic devotion
to the memory of her parents. Then the iron entered
into his soul. He felt the impossibility of
presenting himself to such an innocent being as the
realization of such an ideal as hers. He now dreaded
any chance by which his relationship could become
known to her, as much as he had heretofore eagerly
sought her. All he could do for her he did, but he
constantly watched an opportunity to secure to her
an efficient friend, who could take her into the
world, and withdrawing her from the dull and confined
life she then had, put her into the way of forming
connections for herself which would in some
degree lead her to forget or cease to look for her
father. The agony of being forced to deny himself
every parental caress, lest he should be forced to
explain his relationship, and consequently the reasons
for his long and unpardonable estrangement,
made him wish a thousand times he were dead indeed,
and he said he longed every hour for the time
to arrive when he should take the vow of eternal
silence, for such only harmonized with the gloom of
his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be wearisome to go through all the details
of such a life, of such talents abused, of such a
mournful old age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We talked the matter over freely and fully, and
Herbert concluded with me that it was best to burn
the package, that under no possible combination of
circumstances could it fall into her hands. It should
be his happiness he said to make her forget to look
for her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How he found out how much she could bless
him—and when she discovered that though he was
full of faults, she loved him, faults and all, I cannot
tell; but every body’s experience will furnish
similar instances for themselves or others.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span><h1><a id='how'></a>HOW CHARLEY BELL BECAME SENATOR.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> whole matter is this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tea-things had just been cleared away, the
baby just got fast asleep and laid in his crib, my
wife just got fixed by the round-table making a blue
velvet cap for him, and I had just got comfortably
settled in my arm-chair on the other side of the table,
when Tom returned from the post-office through the
rain and mud and dark bringing one letter. My
wife gave a pish! when I told her it was not from
her mother, but apologized immediately for her expression
when I informed her that the letter—broad,
thick and with a vast deal of ink in the superscription—was
from Charley. Giving the wick of the lard-lamp
another turn she begged me to read it aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tearing off the envelope—drawing my chair a
little nearer the fire and clearing my throat I read—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Rev.</span> W.——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My dear W.</span>—Elected! Apart from all nonsense
and affectation I am heartily glad of it! of course I
received the congratulations of every body here
quietly, as if it was all a matter of course that I
should be elected Senator, but with you I have no
reserve. Know then, my <span class='it'>very</span> dear W., that I am
glad I am elected. For three reasons. First, because
I am elected while just barely of the requisite
age: Second, because I am elected by an overwhelming
majority—20 to 1: Third, because it
places me out in a free and higher field of usefulness
and energy. Why I feel as if I had just begun my
life. I have not attained the <span class='it'>end</span>—only the beginning
of my ambition. I don’t think that it ought to
be branded as <span class='it'>ambition</span>—this feeling of mine either.
I <span class='it'>don’t</span> think it is ambition. It is a purer feeling—A
wish, an eagerness, a <span class='it'>nature</span> to be doing, influencing,
bettering as wide a sphere as I possibly can.
I was elected without any <span class='it'>art</span> on my part whatever.
I told the people exactly what I was, and what I intended
to try to do if they elected me. I intend to
be just exactly what I am! If I were to try to appear
other than exactly <span class='it'>that</span> I would look as well as
feel mean—my arm would falter in every gesture,
my tongue stammer, my knees shake—I would become
weak—weak physically, mentally, utterly! A
pure-minded, single-intentioned, whole-souled manner
in thought, word and deed has borne me thus far
like a straight arrow from a true bow. It is the
shortest, best way to cleave the future, I know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a fourth reason why I do rejoice in my
election. It is because I know that <span class='it'>you</span> will rejoice
in it. It is <span class='it'>you</span> my friend who have made me high-thoughted
and far-thoughted. It is <span class='it'>you</span> who during
the last twenty years have been my good genius—in
your conversation when present with me—in your
correspondence when absent from——”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I read the rest of the letter to my wife, but it is
entirely too flattering to me to be coolly written out
here. Indeed I remarked all along, through the three
more pages which followed, to my wife, that his
encomiums were only the warm expressions of a
warm soul unusually excited, and which must be
taken with all allowance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charley’s letter flushed me through and through.
That my old friend should be elected Senator to
congress from his State I hoped but hardly expected.
Intimate companionship with a friend, you know,
has a tendency to dwindle him in our eyes. Don’t
misunderstand! Intimacy with such a man as
Charles Bell makes one love and prize him more
and more—but does <span class='it'>not</span> make one think more and
more that such a man is suited to be a grave and reserved
Senator. It is just as it is with the Swiss
peasant whose cabin is on a side of Mont Blanc—the
hoary old mountain does not appear a tithe so
sublime to him as it does to some traveler in the
distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I say I felt thoroughly warmed and rejoiced. I
arose, put all my wife’s spools and scraps off the
table into her lap, laid my portfolio and ink-stand
upon it, begged my wife to absorb herself in her
baby’s velvet cap, dipped my pen in the ink and now
have written thus far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All my past intercourse with Charley rushes to
my lips now, as tears do sometimes to one’s eyes.
I want to tell just as briefly and distinctly as possible
how he has risen from nothing to what he now is.
I know much better than he—and if he reads this,
it will do him good. Any-how, I feel in the mood
of writing, and before I go to bed, if my baby don’t
wake with the colic and my wife don’t interrupt me
I will tell you exactly how Charley Bell became a
United States Senator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is, too, that I have a half-hope that some
youth may read this and may get a word which may
wake <span class='it'>him</span> to a higher and nobler life than he has
ever yet dreamed of. If the eye of any such a one
rests on these pages, just one word my fine fellow.
Forget for a little while that everlasting Julia whom
you fell in love with last Tuesday a week ago, and
read with all your soul of souls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot exactly say when I did <span class='it'>not</span> know Charley.
He is some three years older than myself—he
being about eighteen, and I about fifteen years of
age when our friendship began to be a thing to be
remembered. He looked when I saw him a year
ago exactly as he did when we used first to chat
cosily beside his fire-side, about Bulwer and Dora
Anson. He is of a medium size, handsome, earnest
face, forehead broad rather than high. There is a
peculiar gentleman-look about him, wherever he is
or whatever he is doing. He has such an enthusiastic
sympathy with every man, woman and child
he meets with that he is popular of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His peculiarity, however, always consisted in a
hunger after personal excellence. From our first
acquaintance we made a distinct arrangement to tell
each other of our faults as plainly as words could
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
convey meaning. If he did not faithfully do his
part toward me in this arrangement I am very, very
much mistaken. He thought <span class='it'>aloud</span> about me—told
me exactly what I <span class='it'>was</span>, and what I was <span class='it'>not</span>. I did
the same in regard to him. We have acted thus for
many years now. We have been of vast benefit to
each other—and will continue to be till we die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do verily believe that this arrangement had a
good deal to do in making him the man he is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we first became intimate, and had made our
arrangement as above, I opened the war by talking
to him as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charley, my fine fellow, you are ambitious to be
a good speaker. Now—you remember our little
arrangement about correcting the faults of each
other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the plain fact is you have got a most miserable,
squeaking voice. Your chest is narrow, you
stoop, you don’t have that broad, strong, manly appearance
which is almost essential to a speaker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw he winced under this. He <span class='it'>felt</span> eloquence
deeply—he <span class='it'>thought</span> eloquently—and forgot that the
thought must be <span class='it'>expressed</span> eloquently, or it is eloquence
only to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon he made a pair of dumb-bells—and
I do verily believe that he has hardly missed a day
from that to this in which he has not exercised his
chest and his voice in every possible way. No one
would ever think <span class='it'>now</span> that he was not always the
broad-chested, powerful-voiced orator he is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It strikes me that even this little event had something
to do with Charley in his becoming a Senator.
You never saw a narrow-chested man who had any
voice, energy or eloquence in your life. If <span class='it'>you</span>
have got a stoop, my boy, you had better correct it
if you ever intend being any thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I received from him one day a very, very plain
exposition of one of my many faults. Never mind
what it is. He pointed it out to me as you would
point out a rattlesnake in a thicket to any companion
you chanced to be walking with. I saw it—this
vile fault of mine—and have been hunting it, and
striking savagely at it, whenever I detect it stealing
through my conduct with its accursed insidiousness
ever since. Alas! it is “only skotched not killed”
yet. But that is another matter. I only mention it
to say that his very plain remarks gave an edge to
my remarks, as I observed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, Charley, perfectly so—and I war
against that accursed fault forever. But it reminds
me of one of <span class='it'>yours</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charley, you have a vile, offensive, disgusting
habit of chewing tobacco. It is loathsome. If you
would only keep the weed in your mouth, why it
would only poison yourself—but you will be everlastingly
spitting out its juice—and it poisons <span class='it'>me</span>—poisons
me through sight, smell, hearing and feeling.
Don’t use it any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>True to his own true nature, he never took another
quid. Whether this is one cause of his blooming
health and firm nerve I will not say. I <span class='it'>will</span> say
that it is one cause of his astonishing popularity
with the ladies—whether <span class='it'>they</span> know that it is or not—and
thus one cause of this election of his as
Senator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These faults of ours! I said they are like snakes.
So they are. Sometimes a man catches sight of one
of them lying full-length in its loathsomeness in his
own conduct or conversation. Suppose the fault is
self-conceit?—a disease of mentioning one’s self at
all times, which you have contracted. Well, you
see the same fault in some fool or other, or some
Charley Bell tells you of it. The knowledge falls
like a flash of daylight on the vice—you see it! If
it would only perish—crawl <span class='it'>out</span> of you, it would be
well. But the vile thing—crawls <span class='it'>into you</span>—like a
snake into its hole. It does not show its head while
you are watching for it. A day or two passes. You
forget about it—and it is out—drawing its filthy trail
through all your conduct again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is <span class='it'>not</span> a digression. Because I wanted to
say that Charley was a man of too strong a desire
after personal excellence not to wage eternal war
after such vermin. A shrewd observer would have
known the existence of his besetting faults only by
the unusual prominence of just the opposite virtues,
just as you recognize the former drunkard in the
man who has a special horror now of all that can
intoxicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were several minor defects in Charley’s
character, which I pointed out to him, but which he
has so completely conquered that I have forgotten
what they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I really must say something about that Dora
Anson affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora was the brunette daughter of an established
lawyer in our inland village. I see her as distinctly
before me while I write, as if she <span class='it'>was</span> before me.
She was some sixteen years of age—had the usual
amount of education and mind—was unaffected—warm-hearted—black
haired and eyed—rosy-lipped—woman-rounded
form. Charley fell in love—astonishingly
in love with her. I was amazed. He
was of an intellectual, though impulsive nature; and
she had no conversational power—nothing in the
world but a lively, natural, voluptuous sort of beauty,
to recommend her to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Astonishingly in love. He made love to her by
flowers, and was accepted in the same way, before
he went to college. He was absent a year. The
very night of his return he went to a party at her
father’s, which happened that night. He got a seat
near her toward the close of the evening—in a low
voice made a passionate appeal to her, although surrounded
by company—went home—wrote her a still
more passionate letter. He was too impulsive—frightened
her—had his letter returned, and came to
me, and as we sat on a log in the moonlight, told me
the whole. He was about twenty years old then,
and the affection had quickened, expanded, strengthened
his heart even more than that chest-exercise
had his lungs. There was a depth, and breadth, and
force about his affection for Dora which stirred up
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
his whole being. It rolled through him like a sea,
deepening and washing out the sands of his heart till
that heart became deep and broad. For months that
love lived and worked in him; at last it died out like
the steam from the engine of a steamship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I see his hearty affection for his friends—his
warm sympathy for all among whom he mingles,
which gives him his wonderful popularity, I can trace
it all back to that development of his heart under the
hot summer of that love of his for Dora Anson. I do
believe that the genial smile, the cordial manner, the
melting persuasiveness of his tones, all owe their development,
if not their origin, to that culture of his
heart. The sun may have set which shone on his
soul, but it left that soul all ruddy and ripe from its
warm rays. If Dora had jilted him, it would have
left him a soured man. If she had married him, it
would have left him a satiated man. In either case
it would have injured him. But she did not jilt him—did
not marry him; he outgrew so sensuous a love
as that, and somehow or other they drifted apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe, however—and my wife, to whom I have
just mentioned it, agrees with me—that his connection
with Mr. Nelson had very much to do in
making him the man he is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You see, when Charley had finished his law-studies,
his father and mother were dead. He never
had any brothers or sisters. One or two thousand
dollars was his fortune. Being a young man—now
some twenty-five—of fine appearance, and talents,
and manners, he attracted the attention of Mr.
Nelson, a keen and rich lawyer in the village, and in
a few weeks he was settled in his office as a junior
partner. For some six months Nelson seemed
wonderfully attached to Charley—continually spoke
of him with the loudest praise—over-rated him, in
fact. At the close of this period, however, he suddenly
took just as violent a set against Bell as he
had before for him. Nobody ever knew the reason
of this. I don’t think Nelson himself did. The
truth is, the elder partner was a singular man. He
always dressed neatly in black—was rather thin,
with a stooping shoulder, a retreating forehead, a
quick way of talking, and a rapid step. He was excessively
hospitable and generous, more for the sake
of being a sort of protector and superior of the guest
than any thing else. Self-will was <span class='it'>the</span> trait of his
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I am writing about Charley, and have got no
time to paint this Nelson. Enough to say that he
took as vehement a dislike to Bell as he before had
a liking. He ridiculed and opposed and thwarted
him with an astonishing bitterness. Bell, at first, was
staggered with astonishment—then cut to the very
soul with such unkindness from the last man on
earth from whom he expected it. But it did him
great good. It corrected his blind confidence in
every man completely, and gave him a quiet watchfulness
of men in all his dealings with them, which
was of immense benefit to him. It destroyed in an
instant all his false and colored ideas of things. The
faults of his character which Nelson pointed out and
ridiculed, and made the ostensible cause of his alienation,
were forever corrected—just as a wart is burnt
off by corrosive sublimate. Nelson’s extravagant
depreciation of him after such extravagant praise of
him, gave him, in one word, an impulse to prove himself
unworthy that depreciation and more than
worthy the former praise, which did more for him
than if his senior partner had given him years of the
most careful instruction and countenance. Besides,
it threw him suddenly on himself—made an independent
man of him forever. Just what that chest-exercise
did for his lungs, that Dora affair did for
his heart, this Nelson matter did for his will—it
deepened and broadened and strengthened it to an
unusual degree—it did very much toward making
him a Senator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My wife agrees with me that the little love affair
of his with Marie McCorcle had not much if any
effect on our friend. Failing a little in love with
her when he was some twenty-six years old, for a
remark she made in a speech when May Queen, he
proposed in a note—was rejected in a note. Mounting
his horse, he took a ride of some eleven days on
business somewhere. On his return he was over
with it, except of course the feeling of pique. The
first day of his ride he chanted, as he told me, the
words of her rejection to “Old Hundred,” all day
long, over and over and over. The next day it was
to a faster tune. He trotted his horse rapidly back,
making his hoofs keep time to the swiftest jig of his
recollection, as he rode into town with the words
of her rejection still on his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of my task is a pleasant one. I like to
think about Annie Rennaugh—I love even to write
her name. She was a cousin of Dora’s and resided
in the same town. I cannot say that she was
pretty—but I can say that she was beautiful. Just
in this way. She was of a small, modest, quiet appearance.
You would hardly look at her twice if
you saw her in a promiscuous company. Only become
acquainted with her, however, and an irresistible
charm is upon you. There is such a delicious
ease in all she says and does—such a deep mirth and
artless confidence in her that conquers without observation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a special friend of Charley’s. He confided
to her from the very first all his affair with
Dora. I saw him one evening at a party with her.
She was seated in a chair by the door, with a saucer
of strawberries and cream in her lap. He was seated
at her feet in the doorway—enjoying the summer
air—conversing in a low, earnest tone with her as
they took alternate teaspoonsful of the fruit. They
were talking about Dora—Charley’s <span class='it'>ideal</span> Dora—as
earnestly as if they were talking love on their
own account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, the full moon of Dora’s influence waxed into
the full orb of its influence upon her lover, and then
waned, and waned. His friendship, however, for
Annie increased slowly—slowly, but most surely.
When he was whirled away for those four weeks by
Marie McCorcle, he told her all about it, and had, as
usual, all her sympathy. Then he was off for college
and corresponded with her regularly. I was
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
with him in college. Many a time has he torn up—at
my advice—the long letter he had written her,
because it was entirely too warm, even though it
was directed in the most <span class='it'>fraternal</span> manner possible
to “My dear Sister Annie,” and signed, “Your affectionate
brother, Charles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You can see immediately how it all ended. A
friendship begun in mere indifference had ripened
through six years into deep, genuine affection. He
never dreamed that he loved Annie until he found
that she was essential to his existence. For the first
time he knew what true love was. He found that
it was <span class='it'>not</span> the sensual flush of passion, such as
warmed him under the hot beauty of Dora—that it
was <span class='it'>not</span> the fever of the imagination which diseased
him under the moonlight of Marie. He found that
love was not a passion but a feeling; was not a fit
but a condition; was not a hot flush of blood, but the
quick, even, everlasting flow of the heart’s tide,
giving health and life to the whole man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am writing nothing but actual fact, and so I
cannot say how he told Annie his love and how she
accepted him. He has talked to me—I do believe
in all it amounts to several hundred hours—about
Dora and Marie. He has quoted to me at least one
dozen dozen times every word that ever passed between
him and them, but he never told me any thing
about his love conversation with Annie. They are
married. They seem perfectly happy in the quiet
possession of each other and of the blue-eyed baby
boy that laughs in their arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the making of Charles Bell. A remark
of mine has led to the development of his noble
form, and the establishment of that full health so essential
to successful labor. His love for Dora has
expanded his heart and warmed and flushed him all
through and through with an affection and persuasion
and love, that shows itself in his every tone and
smile and clasp of the hand and word. His affair
with Marie has cultivated his imagination perhaps.
His painful experience with Mr. Nelson has corrected
all false ideas of men—has given him caution,
self-possession, self-reliance and energy. He has
learned to meet things as they come; to do his utmost,
and then, not only not murmur at whatever
happens but actually to acquiesce, to rejoice in
every event. Annie is an infinite blessing to him.
He is full of impulse, and she, by a silent, irresistable
influence, controls and directs it. He is full of
noble aspiration but inclined to be fickle—she is ever
pouring oil on the fire of his soul as with an unseen
angel hand—is silent and uncongenial when he wanders
from his better self—and thus draws him quietly
but irresistibly back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course there were many circumstances in politics
and situation which conspired to elevate him to
his present position. I have only alluded to the quiet
under-current of his private life. I wrote what I
have written only because I felt like doing so. I do
not think either he or Annie will be offended at my
freedom should they read this—especially as I have
not mentioned his State or his real name. I am
heartily sick of all romance and romantic ideas and
descriptions of men and women, but I do look upon
the “Hon. Charles Bell and his amiable lady,” as
the Washington papers will call them, as two of the
finest persons in all my knowledge. Both are most
sincere Christians, and singular as it may seem to
some, I regard their companionship and mutual influence
as one which is to last not only through this
poor world, but through all eternity. I would like
exceedingly to write out my ideas on this point, but
I cannot do it now. Besides, the editor may be
married to a second wife, and in that case, would
most certainly refuse admission to this little sketch
in the pages of his magazine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>What</span> a picture of delicious comfort, dear Aunt
Mary,” said Cora Norton, as throwing herself into
the luxurious depths of a <span class='it'>Voltaire</span> chair, and placing
her pretty little feet on the low fender, she looked
around her Aunt Mary’s <span class='it'>snuggery</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cold, misty rain was falling without; but the
ample crimson curtains were drawn closely, so that
no evidence of the inclemency of the weather
was visible within to its two inmates. The cheerful,
crackling fire threw over the chamber and its occupants
“fitful gleams and red,” as drawn closely on
the opposite sides of the fire-place they chatted cosily
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Aunt Mary, you have so much comfort, so
much repose, that I can enter <span class='it'>con amore</span> into your
feelings, as you thus sit so tranquilly in your well-lined,
little nest, and take a bird’s-eye view of the
bustling, plotting, never-resting world. But, dearest
aunty, your darling little pony has just tired me sufficiently,
so as to leave me in a state of quiescence,
<a id='the'></a>in which state one of your pleasant reminiscences
of by-gone days would prove very acceptable. I hope,
my dear aunty, you know how to take a slight hint,
for I am awfully modest about asking favors.” And
she crossed her little hands demurely on her lap, settled
herself still more comfortably, and with an asking
smile on her roguish, pretty face nodded her head in
a very patronizing manner at her aunt, saying, “<span class='it'>Commencez-donc,
s’il vous plaît, ma bonne</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! my little chatterbox, is your tongue worn
out at last, and you really wish to play the part of
listener! But, what shall I tell you? Let us see!
Florence Walton,” continued the old lady musingly,
as she rubbed her spectacles with her silk apron.
“Yes, yes, she is given to ridicule herself, and might
<span class='it'>one</span> day suffer from it, as my poor Florence has done.
Here, Co, count the stitches for the heel in this stocking
for me, with your young eyes, and I will try to
think over something about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen Florence Walton here,” said Mrs.
Jordan, as Cora handed her knitting back to her, “but
you must forget her looks, if you wish to have before
your mind’s eye the proud, beautiful girl of my narrative.
A petted and spoiled child was Florence,
when she and I were school-mates. An only child—beautiful,
talented, and winning in her affectionate
ways—with parents, who were the happy <span class='it'>slaves</span> to
her slightest caprices, how could it be otherwise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember, as though but yesterday, when she
was ushered in among us school-girls by Madame
Gaspard. As natural, we all sat silent and restrained
before the new-comer, who, unused to school-discipline,
and in all the freedom of her, but just-quitted,
home-circle, was in the habit of giving speech to the
first thoughts that presented themselves to mind, without
caring for their fitness, and too proud to show respect
for our opinions, like another school-girl among
utter strangers would have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! I recollect it as freshly as yesterday, and see
before me now the bright, fearless creature, as with
an impatient toss of her glossy ringlets she said half-pettishly—‘Pleasant
as my home, indeed! I wish I
was there now, at any-rate, for I feel here as a cat
<span class='it'>must</span> feel in a strange garret.’ And a smile parted
her saucy lips, as we broke into hearty laughter at
this <span class='it'>compliment</span> from the new girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That quaint phrase of Florence Walton’s introduced
her at once, and frolick and fun finished the evening.
Many, and many were the scrapes that her wit and
laughter-loving propensity has brought upon her, but
through all her affairs beamed forth the evidence of
a noble, generous, bold, but quick temper, impossible
to daunt, but, like the generality of impulsive temperaments,
led child-like and trusting through the affections.
I have seen Florence in after-years, for we
were school-mates a long, long time, throw herself
in a perfect abandonment of tears on her bed, after
answering saucily and with light laughter, some
friend whom she dearly prized—and yet, after remonstrances
from me and advice for the future would reply—‘In
vain, dear Mary, all your good advice, and so
would be my promises of amendment, were I foolish
enough to make them. I know, dear friend, my besetting
sin—know it, and I assure you, I most deeply deplore
my weakness, which would prevent me from
making good any promise I might make you or myself
for the future. As well ask the bird not to fly,
or the fish not to swim, as to make me promise when
irritated, not to use my only weapon—ay! sharper,
I will admit, than a two-edged sword. Mary, it is
my misfortune more than my fault. I have felt—keenly,
bitterly felt—how wrong I am in acting thus.
In casting from me by ridicule and foolish jests, friends
whose affection I dearly prize. Oh! you cannot tell
how I have struggled—how in my own heart-communings
I have determined to be more guarded for
the future. But the future was ever as the <span class='it'>past</span>. My
sin is too strong, and I too weak.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many such conversations have we held together
and I, Cora, was a wicked sinner myself, then, and
knew not God, nor the efficacy of prayer, therefore I
could not tell the erring, but warm-hearted girl, to
cast her burthen at the foot of the Cross; and that
from the knowledge of her <span class='it'>weakness</span> would come her
<span class='it'>strength</span>, for that He, the Mighty One, loved to help
the weak ones, who come as suppliants to his throne.
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
Ah! yes, we were wicked, and only thought of such
things not being <span class='it'>respectable</span>, instead of their sinfulness!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time sped on, working his changes as he ever does,
and our school-days passed like our girlhood, never to
return. Florence and I made every promise of everlasting
friendship when we parted; kept, too, I believe
as faithfully as if made in more mature years. The
first letter I received from her after we had both left
for our homes, told me of the death of her father,
which was very sudden. The newspapers announced
shortly after this, the demise of her remaining
parent, and my heart clung still more fondly to her,
poor thing, for she had no brothers or sisters to sympathize
with her in this sad bereavement. She was
now alone to struggle with the cold world, which
made no allowance for her faults of the head, but
were visited upon her as crimes of a darker die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Years elapsed, and nothing more reached me of
Florence. I married your uncle, dear Cora, and
spent many, many happy years with him <span class='it'>here</span>, in my
little nest as you term it, when death also came to
tear him from me. Then, too, with my sorrow,
came the oftener thoughts of my girl-friend, Florence
Walton. Wondering had she ever married—was she
a mother, a widow—and still above all came the wish
that I could see her once again. I had written to her
frequently, but my letters were never answered, and
so I began to imagine that time had blotted out <span class='it'>my</span>
name from ‘memory’s page,’ or that she had gone
forth into the world under some other cognomen,
and that my letters had failed to reach her. Somehow,
I could never think her dead, there was too
much life and liveliness in my ideal of her, to join
them together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Other thoughts began to have influence over me,
when one day among letters and papers, came one,
bearing my name in her own hand-writing! That
old, familiar penmanship brought back, like some
fondly remembered strain of music, thoughts of childhood’s
happy days, and my heart leaped forth in love
welcome to the writer ere I broke the envelope. How
much more were my feelings stirred within me, when
the warm, passionate nature of Florence beamed forth
in every line. She proffered a visit to me, telling me,
that she too had known sorrow, deep, lasting—and
when she thought of my happiness, she could not
bear to lay open the still tender wound; but I had
suffered, as she had very recently learned, and could
therefore without additional heart-pangs give my
sympathy to a friend, my own, old, wayward, school-friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How quickly did I respond, and urge her to
come speedily, and she came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear aunty,” said Cora, “I recollect her
now. I was a tiny one, it is true, but I remember
well a lady, who dressed in mourning, and was accustomed
to walk evening after evening up and down
the broad portico with you, while I, too, would endeavor
to keep pace with you, till tired out I have
thrown myself across the door-step and slept, unconsciously,
until you became aware of ‘my small
existence,’ and gave me to Elsie, to put in bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear Co, I plead guilty; for the fascination
of Florence’s conversation, tinctured, too, with sadness,
was sufficient to make any one forget their own
identity. It was during that visit she narrated all
that happened to her during our separation. But, as
I am but little skilled as a <span class='it'>raconteuse</span>, I will, after
Elsie has given us our tea, lend you her journal to
glance over. She said, when she gave it to me,
‘This journal, my dear Mary, will bring me and my
trials sometimes before your eyes; for I cannot bear
to be utterly forgotten by the one being who has
loved me through evil as well as good report. Besides,
I think it sinful to remind myself, by looking
over these blotted pages—which, strange incongruity
as it may appear, I cannot bear the idea of destroying—as
they make me unhappy and discontented, by
recalling times past, that were better forever to lie
buried in Oblivion’s stream.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Co, is the manuscript—rather formidable
in its closely written pages; but to me, so full of
interest, that I should have read it were it six times
as long. So, read it to yourself, dear, after you have
given me my tea, and then I will attend to my little
domestic concerns; for though ’tis, indeed, but a
‘wee nest,’ yet the birds of the air do not minister
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dear aunty. Now, Elsie, my good
Elsie, please hurry with the tea-waiter; for I am so
famished with <span class='it'>curiosity</span> to read these yellow leaves,
that I will pardon any supper, if ’tis not <span class='it'>comme il
faut</span>, if you will only hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My readers will imagine the refreshment past—the
wick of the lamp raised—the shade adjusted—and
the fair Cora, with her head supported by one tiny
hand, hid in a shower of curls, seated at the centre-table,
in the most comfortable of all chairs, and deeply
intent upon the pages of</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE JOURNAL</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Tuesday night, June.</span>—Well, ’tis over. To-day
I arrived in my new home; and setting aside my
longing after a <span class='it'>home</span>-feeling, which I have ever felt
since the death of my dear, dear mother, there is no
place that promises more domestic enjoyments than
Alton; especially if Clare, my cousin, will love me
and let me love her. She is a pretty girl, not beautiful,
I admit, but sufficiently comely. My good, kind
uncle, too! I can love <span class='it'>him</span>, I know; for how careful—how
very, very tender was he of my feelings on
our road hither. My room, also, is very nicely arranged;
and as I glance around, I think I may again
be happy, <span class='it'>even</span>, though I am dependent on my uncle’s
bounty. I must to sleep now, for I am too sleepy
now for aught else.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Monday.</span>—Several days have elapsed since I last
wrote; and I begin to love my old uncle in reality.
There is yet another member of our small family circle,
whom I did not see the first day of my arrival.
It is an old lady, claiming cousinship with my Uncle
Alton, and carrying herself with quite an “<span class='it'>air</span>” to
myself. Very strict, too, she seems in her religious
views; and yet sadly lacking in herself that charity
for others which, in my eyes, is the light, “pure and
undefiled.” Ah, me! I must stop, or I shall be
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
wanting in that which I am so lauding. How lonely—how
very lonely do I yet feel! no nearer my <span class='it'>home</span>
of the heart yet, I fear me. My uncle I love; but—my
Cousin Clare is so strange. Can she love, or is
she like one of those incomprehensible characters of
whom I have read, who keep all those feelings hidden
deep within their heart of hearts, until they die
away of themselves, leaving them in reality as callous
as she now seems to me. I have tried to settle myself
to my usual employments. I sew, I read, and
tune my guitar occasionally; and often wander out,
with my books, into those grand old woods around
Alton, and sitting there under their deep, dark shadows,
find companionship in my thoughts. My
Cousin Clare I did ask once to accompany me, but
was refused, on account of household duties; and
Mrs. Dudley added, with an expression of countenance,
to emphasize her speech, “Clare, Miss
Walton, thinks of others besides herself. For my
part, I never admired those tramps through the
woods, of which some young ladies are so fond.”
And her mouth was settled into that self-complacent
expression, as if perfectly satisfied of the effect produced
on me—imagining that poor I must be abashed
into utter prostration before the majesty of her disapproval.
Nevertheless, I still walk, and will continue
doing so, with or without approval, which I
neither value nor seek.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Thursday night, July.</span>—What a difference will
the arrival of an agreeable person make in a country-house.
Now, yesterday and to-day are so rapid,
compared with the preceding weeks. There has
been an arrival at Alton. No less a personage than
Col. Dudley, a nephew, by marriage, to my old
plague. His health, it seems, is not very good—and
he passes the summer here to re-establish it. He
lives in the “sunny South,” and gives me some
glowing descriptions of it. I have some one now
who is in reality a companion; but, although this
seems equally agreeable to me, and to himself, it
does not seem to be relished as well by Mrs. Dudley.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Sunday, September.</span>—Many weeks have elapsed
since I have written in my journal. I have been so
happy, that I took no note of time. Col. Dudley has
been my constant companion; and Mrs. Dudley, his
aunt, though always making little plans and plots to
draw him into her own and Clare’s society—from
which I am as much excluded by my own choice,
as their habitual reserve—has not succeeded as yet.
I am sure to find him at my side, whether in a walk
or ride. And these same glorious woods—so old, so
grand—how beautiful they are becoming now, as the
“melancholy days” draw nigh. What made the
poet say the autumn days were the “saddest of the
year.” I am sure he must have been indulging in a
poetical license, for to me they are infinitely joyous
and gladsome. I know—I feel that Hugh Dudley
loves me; and yet why does he not ask me to be his.
Perhaps he waits for a manifestation of my feelings
for <span class='it'>him</span>; but <span class='it'>that</span> I shall never evince, dearly as I
love him. I know that he is proud—so much so,
that much as I love a proud man, it becomes almost
a fault in him. But I am also proud; and where I
most love, there am I always the most reserved. I
wish him to know “I would be wooed, and not unsought
be won.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Wednesday night.</span>—How happy! how immeasurably
happy am I! I can hardly realize these
joyous feelings! I have just entered my chamber,
too excited for sleep; and seeing my journal lying
close to the writing-desk, have opened it to put in
words, my joy. It appears unaccountable to me,
how, for one moment, I could have imagined myself
happy before, when I compare my present ecstatic
feelings to what I can remember of ever experiencing.
It seems that my heart is opening in love, to the
whole world. I could even take Mrs. Dudley with
the kindest affection to it, if she would allow me;
but why or wherefore she <span class='it'>dislikes</span> me, and <span class='it'>will</span>
manifest that feeling for me. Even my perceptions
of the beautiful have grown so much the more lively;
and the meanest thing of earth—the mossy trunk—the
cloudlet—the sky—the stream—the wild-flower—are
<span class='it'>all</span> floating in an atmosphere of light and beauty.
And why is all this? Oh! my proud heart, you are
now satisfied; and you can answer, why this ecstatic
feeling. <span class='it'>I love</span> and <span class='it'>I am loved</span>! Hugh Dudley—<span class='it'>my
own</span> Hugh—has told me this in words—so wondrously
eloquent—and has, at last, sued me to become
his wife. He wished our marriage to take
place at once; but for all sufficient reasons, I have
begged him to defer it till next summer. Then I
will go forth with him among strangers—with him
who is my world. I have found at last my <span class='it'>home</span> of
the heart. ’Tis in his love—his ardent, disinterested
love. And why did I not marry him at once, and go
with him to his own sunny home? I could not, proud
heart that I am, bear to owe the very dress in which
I should be decked at the altar, to the bounty of my
uncle—how much less to Col. Dudley. Though I
have a home with them—that is, shelter and food—yet
my right hand should be cut off, ere I would take
pecuniary aid from any. They all look cold upon
me now, even my uncle. I have ever conducted
myself respectfully—nay, even affectionately toward
him; but, for some reason or other, he has altered
toward me, and I have drawn myself again into
my reserve. I have undoubtedly thwarted some
cherished plan of his, with respect to Clare and
Dudley; but even my <span class='it'>dependence</span> on him—<span class='it'>gratitude</span>
will not be forced—will not allow me to regret what
has happened. Oh! so contented—so blest am I—that
cold looks from the world are unregarded, so long
as I am conscious of his love. I had been sick, and
sad, for two days and more; my heart and head
seemed bursting, for I could hear, in my chamber
(where sickness kept me prisoner) the sound of mirth
and enjoyment going on below. Even the unwonted
laugh of Clare was echoing merrily, as if my absence
kindled a fire of joy in her bosom of ice; and my
jealous heart told me she was happy, because of the
attentions of Col. Dudley. I could not endure the
thought of his wasting upon her one smile—one
word beyond those of common civility. Very, very
wicked was I on that bed of sickness; for every time
I could hear the voice of Mrs. Dudley calling upon
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
my cousin, in a gladdened tone, I would half utter
aloud, “Yes! that vile old woman is satisfied now.
She thinks he will love that icicle—that automaton.”
Yes, wicked I was, indeed; but then, sick and suffering,
I should have been treated with more sympathy
by those under whose roof I then was eating the
bread of dependence, it would have made it less bitter—not
near so choking. <span class='it'>One</span> ceremonious visit for
the day from Clare—one message of inquiry from
my uncle, was the sole interest that was bestowed
upon me. How can it be wondered at, then, if my
heart grew bitter toward them; ay, even to him, for
if he inquired, it was never told me. But the bitterness
I felt toward him was different from that which
I felt toward my uncle and cousin. When I reflected
on their conduct, there was a mingling of
anger and revenge; when on him, the tears would
rush to my eyes, an aching feeling to my heart, and
I would say, “Could I only die now, would he shed
one tear, or be saddened by the cold, pale face of
her whom he must have known felt something for
him beside mere friendship.” And then I would
hide my eyes in the pillow, and weep in pity over the
sad fate of myself which I thus pictured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As these bitter, bitter thoughts careered through
my brain—increasing its ache—how did I sigh for
the rest of the grave. “For the living know that
they shall die: but the dead know not any thing,
neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
of them is forgotten. Also their <span class='it'>love</span>, and
their hatred, and their envy is now perished; neither
have they any more a portion for ever in any thing
that is done under the sun.” I snatched my journal—in
my longing to unburthen myself of my weight
of wo—and scribbled what I here transcribe, but
which from shame I have since torn out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, oh Father! didst thou see fit to throw me
here in this bitter world, to suffer and to struggle
<span class='it'>alone</span>! Alone must I suffer—alone am I in my
love—alone in my despair—and when dying solitary,
and I am bore to the rest of the grave, I shall
be unwept, unthought of. Well! be it so; only,
Father, teach me to bow in submission and to drink
without murmuring of the bitter cup. I already
look upon the tomb, as the storm-tossed mariner to
his haven of safety, ‘where the wicked cease from
troubling and the weary are at rest.’ Ah! how few care
what the motherless one, cut off from the world by poverty
and other adverse circumstances, must endure.
My wishes and my hopes are mine, and mine <span class='it'>alone</span>.
I feel, as I imagine the deaf and dumb one does,
whose heart is full of love, and bright, warm, beautiful
fancies, and who cannot give them words. To
whom can I utter them? All, all these feelings
must be forever buried in the depths of mine own
sad heart, and nothing but the froth, the foam, and
the weeds, be thrown on the surface for the world’s
gaze. Oh! how I envy those who have fond parents—a
dear brother—a loving sister. How I long
for a sympathy—a resting-place for my affections,
which I despair of ever finding on earth, but which
I hope I may realize with Him, the Father, who
has given me this capability of loving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was written after hearing what my imagination—heated
with fever and jealousy—construed into
a light laugh from Dudley, immediately under my
window. I knew it was <span class='it'>him</span>, for I heard the crashing
sound of his boot-heel on the gravel, and the
mingling tones of his aunt and Clare. They had all
been walking—for I sprang from the bed to ascertain
the fact. Yes, walking! For Clare was leaning
on his arm; her sun-bonnet dangling by the string
from her hand, and to my jealous eye she had never
looked so near to beautiful. Her cheeks were
flushed, and a smile <span class='it'>almost</span> loving parted her lips as
she looked up into his face. They had stopped to
admire a flower, over which Mrs. Dudley still
leaned, and he—apparently—was describing some of
the same kind he possessed. How I hated Clare,
at the moment, there standing with her hand upon
his arm, when there was no necessity for the support;
loving him, too, as I knew she must—though
in what manner I could not picture to myself—for I
had ever thought from her impassable nature it was
the blood of <span class='it'>fishes</span> which filled her veins. As I
looked upon the group my dejection became intensified
into agony. I felt utterly <span class='it'>alone</span>, and I wished
for some kind Samaritan to pour the oil of sympathy
into my bleeding wounds. It was then I wrote, and
in the despair of my soul I felt that all was vanity
and bitterness, and that I had deceived myself entirely—yes,
blindly deceived myself. <span class='it'>He</span> cared not
for <span class='it'>me</span>—whilst I was writhing in pain, <span class='it'>he</span> was merrily
and gleefully laughing with those whom he
knew, as well as I did, loved me not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How changed my feelings now from those penned
above, wrung from me by jealousy and despair!
’Tis as if I had been groping in some dark, noisome
cave alone—ay, alone and fearful—and had suddenly
entered an inner chamber, before unknown, where
a thousand lights are dancing and reflecting against
its brilliant columns and gem-like stalactites pendent
from its illuminated sides and dome—so beautiful—so
sudden has been the change. To begin at
the beginning and tell how came this change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three days had I kept my room. On the
afternoon of the third I stole out unobserved, as I
thought, and made my way to the old, sombre-looking
forest—my favorite haunt—where, under its
dark, umbrageous trees, amid its gloom and solitude,
I sought for companionship for my own sad thoughts.
Seated on a fallen tree, turning with my foot the dry
leaves listlessly, and hearing the moaning and sighing
of the breeze through the tree tops. No other
sound reached me; but I started up wildly—for sickness
had made me nervous—as a hand was laid upon
my arm, and scarcely heard his loved voice, softened
into tenderness, for the loud beating of my own poor
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that I have not frightened you much, dear
Florence. Have you, at last, got well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely; but I am better, Colonel Dudley,
though still I have some remains of my headache.”
And I closed my eyes, which were rapidly filling
with tears, and turned from him my face, that he
might not observe them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
“Your illness has been a sad, sad trial to me, Florence,”
said he, softly. “I missed you more than I
can tell you. My nights have been sleepless from
anticipation and from disappointment at not seeing
you, as I hoped each day to do, when I arose. How
I sighed for your companionship. Even after I went
to my chamber last night, I again left it when the
whole house seemed to be quiet, and wandered <span class='it'>here</span>
to your favorite spot where so oft I have listened to
you. I have inquired each day concerning you till
I am fearful I tired the patience of both your cousin
and uncle. They said you were only slightly unwell,
but that it was your custom to keep your room
when annoyed by companionship not pleasing to
your taste, made fastidious by a long residence in the
city and by novel-reading! You see how candid I
am, but I have my reasons for being thus explicit.
I thought them unkind—I began to think if I were
the one who had wearied you, and memory, faithful
to your charming ways, said at once ‘no’—for I
could see that my company was more welcome than
that of my aunt and your cousin. Nay, start not
from me, dear Florence, I mean nothing to injure
the most sensitive delicacy, but to show you the
meditations to which I have been led by your sickness,
and let you decide for me whether my future
is to be happiness, almost too great for reality, or
entire wretchedness. I blame you not for not seeking
the society of either your cousin or my aunt,
for neither are, or could be congenial; and who, I
am sure, from some cause or other, are not friendly
to you. Tell me now, why did you not send me
even one word, formal though it might have been,
to my bouquet—arranged with as much skill as I
possessed, and bearing its Oriental meaning for your
eye to read?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your bouquet!” And in my surprise I turned
to him my face, forgetful of my tears. “When did
you send it—and by whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tears, dearest Florence! Did you not receive
it? But say that, and a load will have been lifted
from my heart. Did not Miss Clare bring you one
from me yesterday morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never; nor even the simplest inquiry has
reached me from you.” And my eyes looked the
reproach I did not utter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange, very strange! What could have been
their motives for this conduct? Yesterday, dear
Florence, I sent a bouquet, hoping that it would
commence what I have so long wished but feared
to tell you. I sent you a rose-bud and other
flowers, of which you yourself told me the language
when we sat by the window, one rainy afternoon,
longing to be out for this same walk. You
laughingly did as I requested you, instructed me
into their meaning, and I said that when I sent
a bouquet so arranged, the lady who might
receive it must think it uttered what I feared to
say. Ah! Florence, I was sure that you knew I
was speaking in serious earnestness, for your face
colored brightly, and I could see the trembling of
the little fingers as you began to untie the flowers,
though you carefully kept your face averted. Will
you be angry with me when I say, that I began
<span class='it'>then</span> to hope what I so earnestly wish to ask from
you? Do you not understand me, Florence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered not, but sat with face averted, and
head bowed, to hide the emotions his words caused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your answer is needless, for I know that you
long ago have understood my heart. Yes; last night
in this your favorite spot I sat me down to think
upon you, and your winning, artless character. I
felt that with you I should be content to exclaim,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';fs:0.9em;' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>‘Oh! that the desert were my dwelling-place,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;&ensp;With one fair spirit for my minister,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>That I might all forget the human race,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;&ensp;And, hating no one, love but only her.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And that fair spirit you are conscious, sweet Florence,
must be yourself. Say, will you be willing,
dear one, to minister to me through life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could hardly repress the low cry of joy which
sprung from my heart to my lips, yet I did so, and
sat apparently calm at his side, whilst he continued
still more passionately—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; <span class='it'>you</span>, dearest Florence, are the fair spirit
whom I devotedly love. Tell me, can you—will
you be mine? And, though a desert be not our
dwelling-place, make with your love a paradise of
my earthly habitation. Say—answer me <span class='it'>now</span>, Florence,
dear one—will you be my wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not answer—I could not; but I leaned my
face against his shoulder, and, as his arm encircled
me, he bent down his head and whispered what answer
he wished me to make. We left <span class='it'>our</span> favorite
walk engaged—with <span class='it'>one</span> hope—<span class='it'>one</span> love—<span class='it'>one</span> joy.
As if in charming coincidence with our happiness,
how gloriously beautiful was the aspect worn by
surrounding objects. And we asked one another, in
sympathy, could any thing in England, France, or
Italy—in the way of trees—be equal to our forests,
as they then appeared? So many kinds—so many
shades—so differing in foliage: now dense and rich
in living green—now sparse, showing the satiny
boughs of the elm, or the rich brown trunk of oak,
or its mossy covering—now the light, feathery foliage
waving as in spring—all so varying, yet commingling,
and from their very contrasts making the
effect more striking, and forming a whole of harmony,
like unto some gorgeous picture. And then
the sunset, as we stood on a rising hill to gaze upon
his setting, on this our happy evening! ’Twas as
glorious as ever Italia’s sky could boast. Little
cloudlets of burnished gold, whose upper edge wore
a pale violet hue, were floating in a sea of rose;
whilst above and around was the pure azure canopy.
And all these were changing in form and tint, as
lower, and still more low, sunk the sun—like the
fabled changes of the dying dolphin—till the whole
sobered down into the soft gray of twilight. Then
we turned for our walk home. How tenderly did
he fold my shawl around me, and whisper lovingly
as he drew my hand under his arm, that I must be
careful now of my health for <span class='it'>his</span> sake, if I would not
for my own!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we turned into the graveled walk leading directly
to the house, we met Clare and Mrs. Dudley.
I saw them before he was aware they were approaching,
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
for his head was bent toward me as he
uttered words of joy which thrilled my heart, so
long aching for sympathy and <span class='it'>his</span> love, with a happiness
almost amounting to agony. How red grew
my face as their eyes looked full upon us! How
surprised the stare, how cold their passing salutation
to us both! But little either of us recked now.
Every thing with me was forgotten but the certainty
of his loving me, and my promise to become his
wife. When he has gone—ah! here comes the
gloomy shadow in my picture of light. I will form
some plan to make sufficient money, that I may not
be dependent on any one for my simple outfit, and
then we will marry, as I said, next summer. Now,
I can only think of my happiness, which is too ecstatic
for me yet to realize.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Tuesday, Oct.</span>—A fortnight has dragged on—ah!
yes: how truly is it described when I say <span class='it'>dragged</span>
since <span class='it'>his</span> departure, and I wonder to myself how
was it possible that I ever should endure this place
without him—my sunlight!—my joy! In one of the
literary papers which my uncle takes is a notice of
premiums, to be awarded to the successful competitors,
for tales, essays, etc. I have determined to
become one. I have often written—may I not succeed?
I <span class='it'>will</span> succeed. I have a good plan, too, for
a story, founded upon an incident in the life of my
old hero-like grandfather. So, adieu my old friend,
my journal, for awhile; for I must bend all my
existent energies on my <span class='it'>prize</span> story—as I <span class='it'>will</span> it to
be. In doing that and answering Hugh’s letters, the
time at my disposal will be entirely taken up. The
prizes will be awarded before Christmas. I am beginning
to think Mrs. Dudley and Clare suspect my
engagement to Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>November 28th.</span>—Joy! joy! and now for the details—to
confide to you, my journal, in what that joy
consists! My uncle opened the mail-bag, as usual,
this morning whilst we sat at breakfast. There
were two gentlemen present, beside our family
circle, and one of them, a wealthy gentleman from
a neighboring city, and who has always shown
himself peculiarly polite and attentive, at the same
time an interesting and intellectual companion. Mrs.
Dudley and Clare—I forever <span class='it'>couple</span> them together,
for it seems to me they have only <span class='it'>one</span> mind for their
two bodies, and of course, but a small portion for
each—imagine I am “setting my cap” for him; and
according to their general custom, endeavor to set
me in the worst possible light in his eyes. Well!
<span class='it'>revenons à nos moutons</span>, my uncle placed two letters
before me as my share of the precious bag, remarking
as he did so:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One from your punctual correspondent at the
South, and one from Philadelphia. What beau in
that city, Floy, do you write to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Miss Walton”—in a most insulting tone,
said Mrs. Dudley—“is not this foolish correspondence
with my nephew dropped by <span class='it'>him</span> yet? If it
were not for its improbability, I should begin to
fear there was something serious in it; but, then
your encouragement of his attentions was so very
open, that Clare and I said it could only have been
for your amusement and his, to make the time pass
to two idlers. But, once for all, pray inform me as
<span class='it'>his</span> aunt, did you ever dream of any reality in your
game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the hot blood rushed to my temples as I convulsively
grasped the letters to place in my pocket.
Yet my pride came to the rescue at this wanton insult,
and at which her assistant in her schemes,
Clare, sat smiling, triumphantly rejoicing in this
vulgar attack—so turning to her, with a light laugh
of scorn, I replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Your nephew!</span> Humph! Yes; your supposition
does credit to your <span class='it'>ever</span> rightly judging and far-seeing
mind. My flirtation with <span class='it'>your kinsman</span>
could, of course, be only for one’s amusement in the
country!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had paid her back, certainly, for the poor,
wicked old creature’s face colored up in anger as
she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! very well, very well, indeed, Miss Walton.
That is a nice speech for a coquette to make about
an absent gentleman in the presence of another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made <span class='it'>her</span> no further answer, but finishing my
coffee, left the room to read my letters. I could not
help making this answer to her at the time; yet, I
sincerely regret it now. It seems like treason
against my love to utter such a thing about <span class='it'>him</span>,
even to retaliate upon her. The first letter I opened
was from Hugh Dudley—breathing the most devoted
love—begging me to shorten his term of
exile, and let him come, at once, to claim me for
his own. The other was from the editor of the
——, and contained a check for one hundred dollars!
My story had obtained the second prize. Now, I
<span class='it'>can</span> think about what Hugh has written, I will write
to him to-morrow, and tell him I will consider his
proposition. I must not grant it at once, for I am
ashamed to let him see how much I love him.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>December 18th.</span>—How busy they are preparing
for Christmas; yet I cannot enter into their feelings
of mirth. A presentiment is haunting me—a shadow,
like the gloom of the grave, is around me. I cannot
answer why this is so. Foolish that I am! I have
gone forth to my favorite walk; I have recalled the
words—the vows of love—his tender looks, as he
offered them; and yet the cold, dead feeling at my
heart will not be driven forth. As I entered the
parlor yesterday, in the dim twilight, softly—for I
was thinking sadly, as I am wont <span class='it'>now</span>—I heard Mrs.
Dudley say to Clare, “<span class='it'>Depend on it, Hugh Dudley
will not marry</span> <span class='sc'>HER</span> <span class='it'>at least</span>.” I do not think she
saw me; but Clare’s cold eyes rested on me with a
most malignant glance, as I quickly drew back, ere
they should be aware of my entrance. I know, oh,
heart of mine! how foolish ’tis for me to grieve. Is
this the confidence I have in his love—his vows—his
honor—to be thus shaken for <span class='it'>one</span> moment by the
assertions of an evil-minded and plotting old woman,
who manifestly hates me. I <span class='it'>will</span> tear this feeling
from me. I will not despond—I will trust in you, my
own noble-hearted Hugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January.</span>—’Tis strange! no letters from Col.
Dudley. Can he be ill? Oh! this sickening suspense—this
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
living death! I fancy, too, that my
enemies—for so I must call Mrs. Dudley and Clare—watch
me narrowly—triumphantly. What can it
mean? Oh, Father! in thy mercy, spare me this anticipated
misery! Let the bitter cup pass from me,
if thou wilt; for I feel my utter weakness and inability
to bear up under these harrowing thoughts.
Impossible! I will not pen any thing against his truth.
He must be sick. Not even to this mute witness of
my love will I own, that even in <span class='it'>thought</span> I suspect
him. I will show him this one of these days yet to
come, when the happiness I then shall feel will repay
me for all my sorrows—and then he will know how
much he was loved. “Absence makes the heart
grow fonder,” says the song—and it is true with me,
at least, I wonder, is it the case with him. I will
go down now—for everybody is away to-day, shopping
in the neighboring town—and play all his favorites,
and cheat myself with the belief that he is
beside me—that I feel his warm breath play among
my curls—that, on the lifting of my eye, I shall meet
his glance, so full of love and trust, as to shame me
in my inmost heart for ever <span class='it'>thinking</span> he could prove
false.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February.</span>—Oh, God! how unspeakably miserable
am I. And you, old friend, that has been the record
of my joy—my short dream of happiness—be also
the page upon which I chronicle my grief—my deep
despair. I am calmer now; I did think that I should
have crazed under the blow; but the Father has
strengthened and borne me up. I had been expecting
an answer to my last letter from Hugh, (oh! how
anxiously, for ’twas past the usual time,) when one
day my Uncle Alton sent for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Florence,”—as I entered—“I have a package for
you, sent under cover to myself. I am afraid that
this will prove a sad trial to you; but as you have
your own self to thank for it, I am in hopes, for your
sake, it will not occasion you much heart-grief. I
am playing the part of Job’s comforters; but I cannot
help saying to you, that you should remember how
you speak of the absent, for sooner or later, they
always are informed of bad speeches by some injudicious
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does this long preface lead to, Uncle
Alton,” said I, with a smile, though my heart felt
heavy as lead, and as cold. “Surely I am not mixed
up in any of the neighborhood slander, I hope. I
always thought that you did me the justice to imagine
that I care little, and talk less, of the worthies
who compose the society attainable at Alton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My uncle, by this time, had handed me the package
which he had been separating from its envelop; and
he now coldly, I may say sternly, addressed me,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hugh Dudley, Florence, has written me that
you and himself were engaged—solemnly pledged to
each other to wed the coming summer. From your
speech, made in public, in the presence of his friends
and relative, from whom he has received the information,
he now releases you from your chains, that he
thinks must have been galling, to call forth from you,
in public, so unprovoked, so cruel a speech. What
renders it still more stinging, was the fact, that Mr.
Hilton, one of the gentlemen present, has ever been
an enemy of Dudley’s, and on his return home (for
he lives not very far from him) repeated it among a
certain set. After Dudley heard of this he gave the
more ready credence to his aunt’s letter, which
came whilst the subject was in agitation in his
thoughts. He wrote to me, as your nearest friend and
protector, explaining his conduct, and requesting me
to hand you your letters. It has grieved me to hear
of this conduct, heartless as I must call it, from my
sister’s child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt like throwing myself at my uncle’s feet,
and begging him to plead for me with Hugh in
my great misery; but, at this moment I looked up,
and saw Mrs. Dudley standing near the entrance,
and peering on me with such a smile of malicious
triumph, that crushing back my real feelings of agony
with my al-conquering pride, I said lightly, though
it seemed as if my heart were weeping blood the
while—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not trouble yourself, uncle, about my incapacity
for bearing this, especially as you say it was
brought on me by my own means. Inform Col. Dudley
when you write, that I accept my release with
thanks, and never have, nor could ever claim relationship
with some of his kin, but with the same feelings
of loathing and disgust I experience when some
hideous and dangerous reptile crosses my path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was nerved by my anger against Mrs. Dudley to
say this, and to act the part I assumed, of carelessness,
for I took up the package with a light laugh,
thanked my uncle, and dropped a very lowly reverence
to her as I approached the door, saying, “I
hope, my dear madam, that your truly <span class='it'>Christian</span>
heart is now at rest, having seen the end of our game,
begun to relieve the tedium or worse of a country-house,
blessed with such an inmate as your venerable
self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have a dim recollection of seeing her eyes open
wide and still wider with perfect amaze, and the
words “heartless flirt,” fell from her lips. I reached
my room, though my pride was fast ebbing, and
locked myself in. I opened the bundle—my own letters
came tumbling therefrom, and <span class='it'>one</span> from <span class='it'>him</span>. I
put it here, that with the record of my willful error,
its punishment may also be seen.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Miss Walton</span>,—I return you your letters, and
your vows of love—when the substance is not possessed,
how worthless is the shadow. I scorn myself
for having loved one who could so wantonly trifle
with a trustful, loving heart, which has been taken
when proffered, to throw away as a worthless object.
May you be happy, but that I am afraid you will not
be. I hope that you will be more careful of the next
heart that you may witch to love you. At least,
never say of him in the presence of either friends or
enemies, “he will do well enough to amuse one’s
self with in the country!” I again say, may you be
happy, and as my happiness can only be in forgetting
you, I shall never seek to hear of you; and rest easy
that this will be the last letter with which you will
ever be troubled from the hand of</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Hugh Dudley</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
It was over! and I sat long silent and motionless
with the letters before me. I then determined to bear
uncomplainingly my fate, and never let <span class='it'>him</span> know
the agony which his thus breaking <span class='it'>our</span> engagement
had caused me. “Did I die from it,” was my proud
resolution, “I will die in silence. He, to believe so
quickly, so readily, an assertion made against me,
by an enemy of his, and proved by an enemy of
mine. Did he ask me, ‘Was it so—and wherefore?’
No: but acted on the information, careless
of my pain—oh! well he knew that I loved him—and
exulted in it from revenge. Had he asked me,
oh! how humbly would I have acknowledged my
fault, and throwing myself more trustingly on his
love, how would I have prayed for forgiveness, till
the proud man, in his strength, would have been
softened by my tears, and taken me again in love to
his bosom.” But it was over, and she who had
caused this misery should not triumph. I jumped
from my seat, bathed my eyes, curled my hair elaborately,
decked myself in a most becoming dress, and
on seeing my ashy cheeks, in the glance I gave into
the glass, for the first time painted them with carmine.
I then descended into the drawing-room.
Mr. Harold, the wealthy merchant from the city,
whom I have spoken of, had returned the day before,
on a visit to my uncle, and for him, and to him,
I played and sung. I was in my wildest spirits. I
kept up this farce for weeks whenever the eyes of
the household were upon me, till I thought in the
struggle my mind must give way. At this crisis a
letter came from a cousin of my mother, to whom I
had written to ask for an asylum, gladly welcoming
me to her home—for she was aged and infirm, and
wanted companionship. I accepted at once; received
a cold acquiescence from my uncle—a still
more indifferent one from my cousin—and set out
for my new home in Kentucky, determined to hide
myself forever from the eyes of those whose triumph
was built on the ruins of my happiness. Oh! Hugh,
could you have known how deeply I have repented
of that speech, wrung from my wounded pride, even
you would have forgiven me and loved me still—but
you never, never loved as I did you. But it is, as I
said, all, all past; my dream is ended, and I now
walk sadly my allotted time on earth, a sorrower
and a sojourner in a vale of tears.</p>

<hr class='tbk140'/>

<p class='pindent'>Here ended this sketch from her journal; and
Cora Norton sat at first meditating, with her head
still leaning on her arm. Turning at last to her aunt,
who was dozing across the room, she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has become of Col. Dudley, Aunt Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ech! what!” exclaimed the old lady; and then
being thoroughly roused, she took her knitting from
the floor, where it had slipped during her nap, received
from Cora her spectacles, and upon her niece
repeating her inquiry—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is now,” said Aunt Mary, gaping and rubbing
her eyes, “the husband of Clare Alton, and
lives in his far distant home—at least so I heard
about five years since, the only time I ever heard of
him. It is said that the match was made up for
him entirely by his aunt, and that Clare is an excellent
housekeeper—raises more chickens and turkies
than any lady in the neighborhood. She, as my informant
told me, is quite the <span class='it'>model</span> housewife of her
neighbors, and has finished a hexagon bed-quilt, of
I don’t know how many thousand patches. As to
herself and the colonel, they get along very politely
I believe—</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>FROM THE GERMAN.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='sc'>Does</span> thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and
cast it from thee.’ That is in the Bible, to be sure,
but it is no remedy for this terrible pain,” sighed
the suffering Pastor Seidelman, “for if it goes from
my hands I have it in my feet, and if I were to cut
off all my limbs what would become of his reverence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Conrad,” said his faithful nurse and wife,
and smiled through her tears, “you are always so
cheerful in the midst of your sufferings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not, Catharine? Am I master of this
pain, or its slave? And can I not always imagine
that these limbs belong to some one else, and that I
have nothing to do with them? But the hardest to
bear is, that the miserable things keep me here in
this arm-chair, whilst every thing without there is
so blooming and beautiful; the wall-flowers and
harebells are just as fine, or finer in my garden than
in Herman &amp; Hübner’s—that I cannot on this glorious
evening feast upon strawberries with you all
in the arbor, and that you, dear Catharine—this is
the worst—must be confined here to nurse me. Has
the spring-time of our life all vanished?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Conrad,” said his wife cheeringly, and
stroked his pale cheeks, “we have so many blessings
left—our love and our children. Let us thank
God for all—for our joys, and for our sorrows too.
Ah, if you could only go to the springs at A——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said the pastor, “but never mind.
The springs are distant and dear. I have given it
up long ago. Sometimes, indeed, it seems as if it
would be a little thing for my lord count up on the
hill to treat his old pastor to the journey. But he
must need all his money for the gay life he leads at
the capital—oh, no! he is not to be thought of, nor
the springs either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This had been the conclusion for the last ten years
of every conversation between the worthy people,
whenever the subject was the health of the good
pastor. What availed him his duties so faithfully
performed, the love and veneration of his flock, his
gay world of flowers just outside the door, and his
circle of blooming children? There he sat in the
great arm-chair, while without the birds were singing,
the lindens in full leaf, the little six-years-old
Paul was exercising a troop of wooden soldiers, the
gentle Hermine dancing merrily, and in a distant
part of the garden the beautiful Theodora was walking
with her youngest brother, the little pet, Ernst.
Indeed, the worthy Seidelman might well be happy,
surrounded by all these treasures. But he was
bowed down by disease, not of mind, but of body;
and he was very poor, though that was no one’s
fault but his own. For how in the world was any
one with such a soft heart ever to grow rich. His
house was always open to the needy, and not rarely
to the wolf even in sheep’s clothing, and often when
on his return from some wedding, his wife would
search anxiously in his pockets for the fee, he would
say, with a look of shame and contrition, “Don’t
be vexed, Catharine, I have given it to Gottlieb, he
has broken his leg;” then both would smile through
their tears, and the orders to the butcher for the next
week would be countermanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one other grief burdened the worthy people.
Anxiety on account of their favorite child Theodora,
just eighteen years old, and so gentle, who became
every day more and more estranged from them. In
his sleepless nights of pain, she left the care of her
father entirely to her mother and her sister Hermine,
and shut herself up in her room, where they saw
her candle burning until long after midnight, and to
their anxious questionings she gave only confused,
unsatisfactory replies. But now, when the roses in
her cheeks had begun to fade, her father and mother
had determined that, when twilight came, when she
always went to walk in the large garden, they would
penetrate into her securely-locked apartment, and
solve, if possible, the sad riddle. And they had selected
this evening for the attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There she strolled through the dark linden walks
on this lovely summer evening, with her little brother.
But there was even more joy in her heart
than in the glad singing of Ernst, and the setting sun
mirrored itself in her eyes, sparkling with delight.
“Sink into thy golden cradle, thou friendly light;
with thy setting arises a holyday for us all, thy Easter
morning, oh, dear father.” Thus she exulted, all
unconscious of the treachery meditated against her
by the anxious love of her parents. And just at this
moment, when, full of happiness, she bent down
over a hedge of roses, suddenly the fate of her future
life stood before her, a youth of most prepossessing
appearance. He started at the sight of the fair girl,
and greeted her with evident embarrassment. Theodora,
too, was confused, she knew not why, and
her handkerchief dropped from her trembling hand
while she turned hastily away. He picked it up,
hastened after her, and in a gentle voice, but with a
foreign accent, begged pardon if his sudden appearance
had alarmed her, and hoped that on so beautiful
an evening he might not be the cause of shortening
her walk. But her walk was interrupted, and
she turned toward home much sooner than she had
intended, just in time to frustrate, for this evening
at least, the design of her parents, who were just
upon the point of ascending the stairs to her room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, when supper was finished, and the pastor
was lighting his evening pipe, with the children
playing around him, what heavy parcel does Theodora
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
bring in, and what drops are those shining upon
her cheek? “My dear father,” she said, “I bring
you here the money—a hundred dollars—which I
have earned for you. It is little, but it is enough to
carry you to the springs. Now you will be well
once more,” and she sunk into his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagine the happiness of this moment. The children
left their play and gathered round their parents;
the father weighed the gold incredulously in his
hand, and the whole secret was disclosed amid
thanks and kisses. Upon the altar of filial love Theodora
had laid the hard earnings of her needle. For
two long years she had sewed and embroidered with
unremitting industry, while every one else was
sleeping. Her cheeks indeed were pale, and she
had been for a while estranged from those who were
dearer to her than all the world beside, but she had
gained the reward that she had striven for so long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Present arms!” cried Paul to his soldiers;
“don’t you see, you rogues, in whose presence you
are standing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear one,” said her father, “you have
worked hard indeed for me, for us all, and thy days
shall be long in the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More brightly than the star-spangled heaven without,
shone the heaven glittering with new hopes and
joys within the little parsonage. “You will be well
again,” cried the children, “you will be able to
dance just like us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered their father, “to dance, and
ride, and—but only think, Catharine, of my really
going to the springs! I can hardly believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all talked over the journey with the comforting
conviction that it was no longer a mere
vision, and it was unalterably determined that Theodora
should accompany her father. The council
sat until far into the night, that every thing might be
discussed—what they should carry with them, and
through what towns and villages they should pass
on their journey. But when the village watchman
called “Twelve o’clock,” the father knocked the
ashes out of his pipe, and said, “Children, it is late,
we shall have a whole day to-morrow.” Paul shut
up his soldiers in their barracks made by some old
folios on the lowest shelf of the book-case, and certainly
the god of slumber never embraced happier
people than the inhabitants of that little cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theodora alone could not sleep. Her mind was
too much excited to be quickly composed to rest.
As the moon shining on drops of dew causes them
to emit sparkles in the dark night, which vanish
again suddenly, so dreams and fancies sprung up in
Theodora’s mind, and she hardly suspected that the
stranger in the park was the chief cause of her excitement.
Without any distinct thoughts of him,
and without the remembrance of a word that he had
said, his image was, in the confusion of her mind,
like the foundation color in a landscape, like the
<span class='it'>thema</span> in one of Beethoven’s symphonies. Only in
her short morning slumber did his image present itself,
as he handed her the handkerchief. But the
dream vanished before the clear light of the morning
sun, and the day with its busy plans and thousand
occupations dissipated the half-formed visions of the
night. Again, however, twilight came with its
shadows, its cool breezes, and its memories, and as
she again strolled down the garden with her little
brother, her heart fluttered with feelings of alarm
and anxiety. She feared that the young stranger
would suddenly stand before her again, as he had
done upon the preceding evening, and yet she could
not keep away from the dangerous spot. But no
stranger appeared; she glanced timidly down the
dark walk, but nothing was to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, lost in thought, she stood before the very
rose-bush where she had first seen him the day before.
But her reverie was suddenly interrupted, for
Ernst sprung from behind a large lilac-bush, dragging
the stranger with him, and crying, “I have
you, you rogue; you want to play hide and seek
with Dora, do you? Away with you!” With a
frank smile the young man, yielding to the child,
approached the blushing girl, who would fain have
turned away. “Hold him fast,” cried Ernst, “or
he will run away, and before I can get my horsemen
out to follow him he will be beyond the mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will he not, my little fellow,” said the
stranger, and then turning to Theodora, he frankly
confessed that only the hope of seeing her again had
prevented his continuing his journey with his father.
He told her—but who can tell with pen and ink
what a youth, only twenty years old, who has at
first sight fallen head over ears in love, says to a
beautiful girl, at such a romantic hour and on such
a lovely spot?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theodora herself hardly knew what he had said,
but only (when two hours afterward she slowly
walked toward her dear home) that he had poured
out the most ardent protestations of love, and that,
although obliged to leave on the morrow for, she
knew not what part of the country, he had promised
to return. Whence had come that sparkling ring
upon her finger, and whither had gone the rose that
she had worn all day long in her bosom? His name
she knew was Robert, but all else that he had said
about himself and his family had vanished from her
mind. He was going away on the morrow with his
father, whither, she had not the remotest idea, and
to inquire about him was out of the question. The
vision had vanished, but the diamond on her finger
sparkled consolingly, and she drew it off, to keep it
carefully until it should be redeemed by the donor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was consumed in preparations for
the journey, and on the following morning, after all
had been refreshed by the hot coffee, and the father
had prayed, “May God bless our goings out and our
comings in,” he was warmly packed in the neat
traveling-carriage, with Theodora at his side; leave
was taken of the dear ones who must stay behind,
and they drove off. As the tall tops of the trees
seemed to nod a kindly farewell in the fresh morning
air, Theodora thought longingly of the last few days,
and shrunk from the unknown future. She determined
to lock up her hopes and fears in her own
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
breast—for how could she speak of them to her
father. An accidental meeting with a young stranger
was, as she would fain persuade herself, such a commonplace
occurrence; and her father, too, was so
occupied with the journey, with thoughts of the old
friends whom he should see, and, above all, with
the flowers which, whenever they passed a garden,
threw him into ecstasies, that a fit opportunity never
presented itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they approached A——, through a beautiful
landscape, they met glittering equipages and horsemen,
and gayly-dressed parties of pedestrians. Music
sounded from the lighted saloons, and a new world
opened itself around the young girl. But anxious
emotions filled her heart, and she longed for the
quiet home-circle of mother, brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still she breathed more freely as she entered her
quiet little room in their lodging-house, where every
thing was so neat and convenient; even the piano
had not been forgotten, and the window opened upon
the pretty little garden belonging to the house, where
were green lindens, fragrant lilies, and an arbor of
woodbine, like the one in dear R——. “Oh
heavens!” cried her enraptured father, “there is the
double lychnis chalcedonia, blooming in greater perfection
than my single one; and there (it can be no
dream) there, Theodora, is the white Georgina, which
I have never seen before, growing among those pinks
and carnations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every thing was delightful. Their domestic
arrangements were soon made, and, on the following
morning, the spring which was to give health to the
invalid was tried, while Theodora sat at home in the
garden and worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many parties of fashionable promenaders passed by,
and troops of horsemen galloped past; but Theodora
heeded them not; and when her father returned, she
was ready to receive him; they partook of their
frugal meal, and then came singing and the piano.
But early one morning, as she sat at work—heavens!
who was that who flew by upon his foaming English
steed? She dropped her work in her agitation,
but the stranger, no less surprised, reined in his horse,
sprang off, rushed up the little garden, and greeted
her with the warmest expressions of his surprise and
pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely capable of replying, Theodora returned
his greeting, but instantly her confusion overcame
her, and she asked, with a deep blush, how he,
whom she had thought so distant, came to be just
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, this place,” was his reply, “is the destination
of my poor father’s journey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are here for the same purpose that we
are?” asked she. “What is your father’s disease?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! let me be silent upon that point,” sighed
Robert; “I am very unhappy. But I trust in God
that these clouds will clear off; and now that I see
you, all seems brighter and more hopeful. And,”
continued he, gazing searchingly into her clear, calm
eyes, “I am very vain; but your looks tells me,
Theodora, that you still remember those happy
meetings in R——. You shall learn to know me;
you shall not find me unworthy of your love; and
then I will place the decision of our fate in your
father’s hands, and <span class='it'>my</span> father, too—why can I not
lead you to him now, and say, ‘See, father, the happiness
of your only son.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why do you fear him?” said Theodora,
“does he know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must not say,” sighed Robert; “the hand of
fate is heavy upon me now; but here and there I
can discern through the clouds the clear blue of
heaven. O, trust in me, Theodora, if I am an outcast
<span class='it'>now</span>, trust my heart, full of love, if there is in
yours one spark of interest in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thorns in this declaration pressed deep into
the heart of the poor girl. Confidence, love, and
doubt raised a wild warfare in her breast; she saw the
heaven of her pure first love so overclouded, and she
saw Robert depart with a heavier heart than she had
ever known before. The next day, and the next,
while her father was bathing, Robert was with her;
and although her confidence in him grew continually,
the riddle grew more dark and mysterious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say not a word even to your father of our love,”
said Robert; “I plead only for a little time, and I
myself will open my heart to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As long as he was with her, she felt consoled, but
with his departure, her peace fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy father, in the meantime, did not perceive
his daughter’s increasing melancholy. Two
weeks had done wonders for him; every day he
grew stronger. The reviving air breathed new life
into the worthy man. “O, my child,” said he, joyfully,
throwing open the gate one day, at the commencement
of the third week, “what do you think
I have seen? You will scarcely believe it; but it is
really so—a <span class='it'>Banksia serrata</span>, in full bloom, stands
in the castle garden. O, Dora! the exquisite contrast,
such heavenly blue and gorgeous yellow! I—but
you must see it; and, only think, the gardener
has promised me a shoot! God <span class='it'>has</span> blessed our
goings out and our comings in; only see how well I
can move my arm; in another week I shall be as
well—better than ever. But there is so much misery
here—if I were only rich; and there is one man so
wretched, who, dressed in a miserable old gray coat,
walks about all day amongst the gay and happy—if
I only had a little money for him, he should find his
health, too, in these glorious baths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus spoke the old man out of his grateful, child-like
soul, and never noticed how little part Dora took
in his joy and kind wishes, or how pale she had
grown. But the next morning, deeds followed the
good pastor’s words. On his return from the bath,
he hastened to the garden, and there stood the flower
that he so dearly loved, with its magnificent leaves
and petals upon which the sun shone, making the
dew-drops glitter with a thousand rainbow tints, and
on every side bloomed the rarest plants. “Great,
indeed, are the works of the Lord,” said the enthusiast,
taking off his cap reverently. Just at this moment
the old man in the gray coat, his head bent
down, and his hands behind him, as usual, passed
by. “Ah! <span class='it'>Banksia serrata</span>,” murmured the pastor
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
to himself, “no misery should exist where you
bloom in such beauty;” and half unconsciously he
put his hand into his pocket, drew out his purse,
slipped it in the old man’s hand, and then vanished
in the crowd. “Now you will have a happy day,”
cried he, in his innocent joy; “perhaps it may cure
you—who knows.” But now, like the book of the
Evangelist, which was first honey and then bitterness,
a serious consideration rushed on the mind of
the pastor. He had sacrificed upon the altar of humanity
far more than half the pittance which was
supporting him at the baths, and had barely enough
remaining to pay for the journey back to R——.
“Theodora,” he said, as he entered their little room,
“you must pack up every thing; I have done a
foolish thing—my heart ran away with my head; I
have given away the twenty dollars that were in the
purse, and the purse besides. We must go home in
two days at the furthest, if we do not wish to beg
our way back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” cried Theodora, bursting into tears,
“let us go to-day—as soon as possible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, my child?” asked her father,
terrified and amazed at her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! unconscious father, while you stood before
your beloved flower, and returned thanks to Heaven
for its beauty, the heart of your poor child was broken,
and the rose of her pure love crushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theodora had been working all the morning in the
garden, as usual; but not as usual did Robert appear
at the appointed time. In her anxiety at his non-appearance
she was not even allowed the blessing
of retirement and silence—for the talkative landlady
brought a friend to the garden, whom she wished to
introduce to the pretty stranger from R——. Now
if Robert came, he would have to retreat—for the
departure of these gossips was not to be thought of.
But he came not; and she was listening in despair to
the last stroke of ten o’clock, when a dashing barouche
whirled by, containing upon the back seat
two gaudily-dressed ladies, between whom sat—Robert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He boldly threw a kiss to poor Dora, and the
ladies, lifting their eye-glasses, honored her with a
long stare, followed by a burst of laughter. Theodora
grew pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know that man?” asked the landlady;
“he is the most dissipated fellow here, and a gambler
by profession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And his companions,” added the friend, “are
low people from the capital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Theodora! with difficulty she kept from falling,
but the paleness which overspread her face
alarmed the good landlady, who hurried her into the
house and administered all kinds of restoratives.
When she was alone tears came to her relief—“Ah!”
sobbed she, “how could such fair, earnest
words come from a heart so vile. But I will pluck
this love from my heart, and then farewell peace
and hope in this life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let us go from this dreadful place,” said
she to her father when she had told him all;
“you are quite well again. And this ring—he
gave it to me as a pledge of his truth; take the
glowing jewel from me, father dear, it burns into
my soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor child,” said her father, “you will indeed
be happier in our quiet home; as for this ring,
it could only have been given to you by one to whom
thousands are as nothing; only by some wretched
gambler. And all this mystery that he has preserved.
Oh, yes! I see it all. Thank God, my
child, that he has delivered you from a gambler, that
he has separated your lot from his, for whom there
is no love, no home, who can live only in the heated
air of the saloon, amidst the despairing cries of the
losers and the greedy exclamations of the few whom
chance favors! Pack up every thing; the day after
to-morrow we will set out for dear, quiet R——,
where Heaven will rain down peace upon thy heart,
as it has already poured its blessing of health upon
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus with affectionate words did the father drown,
at least, the voice of sorrow in his poor child’s heart,
and for the first time, at the approach of evening,
she accompanied him into his sanctum, the garden.
But the brilliant colors of the flowers pained her
with the contrast between them and her own heart.
Red is the color of happy love, and ah! Theodora,
these are not for thee—there under the weeping-willow
blooms thy flower, its leaves are the color of
the blue above, and although the faithless waves at
its foot are always flowing on, its image is always
mirrored in them; so, Theodora, will thy love remain
while the river of thy life flows on, and faith
will ever repeal in thy heart—“Forget me not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Banksia serrata</span>,” cried her father joyfully, and
led her to the beautiful plant. She gazed enchanted.
Here was no gaudy mixture of colors, no dazzling
brilliancy. Gentleness seemed to breathe in the fragrance
wafted from the flower, that heavenly blue—it
was her own forget-me-not exalted to honor. Her
eyes filled with tears, the sight had comforted her,
and she loitered quietly back through the long promenade
with her father; outshining in her simple
beauty the crowd of fashionables collected there at
that hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he is,” said her father, trying to elude the
recipient of his morning’s bounty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man had seen him, and stepping up to
him, growled out—“Sir, a word with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, wait for me there, upon that bench, Dora,”
said her father. And she went timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” said the stranger, “is that your daughter?
I suppose she is good-for-nothing, but she is a
pretty creature, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As concerns yourself,” he continued, in broken
German, “it would, I suppose, be impolite if I should
say, ‘My friend, are you a knave or a fool?’ so I
will restrain my curiosity, and only ask how you
know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” replied the pastor, “I do not know you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t deny it,” said the other; “was it not
you who slipped the purse into my hands this morning?
You think to plant your grain in fruitful
ground. Few here look as ragged as I, but how came
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
you to know of the gold under the rags? But this
stupid speculation of yours will never succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” interrupted the pastor, with dignity, “what
do you think of your fellow men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worst,” said the old man; “they are all as
good-for-nothing as I am. But you have thrown
your money away, which you seem to need yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have not thrown it away,” replied the
pastor; “you are sick, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not your friend; I have no friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, wretched indeed are you if you have no
friend; then indeed you have nothing. Yes, you are
really ill in body and mind. What I could do to
cure the disease of the first I have done, and it is
not worth speaking of, but to relieve the last I can
bring to my aid, though I am very poor, the consolation
of sympathy and—religion. I am the Pastor
Seidelman, from R——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! the Pastor Seidelman!” cried the old
man; “and that beautiful girl is your daughter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is,” replied the pastor; “you know nothing
of us, but let me know enough of you to afford you
all the consolation in my power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So saying, he drew the old man to a seat under
the lindens, and sat down. His heart, overflowing
with gratitude for the blessing of his renewed
health, poured itself out toward the stranger in
words so full of sympathy that they seemed half to
provoke a spark of kindliness in the stranger’s
breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By heaven!” he cried, “you are the most endurable
man I have yet met with in my wretched
life, and ten times better than I. Is it so? Can I find
such a thing as a friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is certain,” said Seidelman; “I am your
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am a wretched beggar, crazed by the ingratitude
with which my native country, England,
has sent me helpless out into the world. I can never
reward your kindness—I can give you nothing but
my misery. Will you still be my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with us to R——,” cried the pastor, “we
are poor, too, but you shall not want loving care,
and Theodora shall nurse you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, call the girl here,” said the stranger; and
Theodora modestly approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The countenance of the old man grew more and
more cheerful as he talked with the honest pastor
and his lovely daughter. But suddenly he started
up, grasped the pastor’s shoulder with trembling
hands, and stammered—“I am ill—I must go home.”
Then, refusing their offers of assistance, he promised
to meet them on the same spot the next day, and
was quickly lost in the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pastor and his daughter returned to their
lodgings, thinking and speaking of nothing but the
strange old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We sent him away,” cried the landlady, as she
met them at the garden-gate, “he has been here
twice; quite pale with terror, but it is good for
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” asked the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the gambler, to be sure.” And poor Theodora
shrunk into a dark corner of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father inquired his name and direction of the
landlady, and immediately inclosed the costly ring to
him in a note which ran thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>—Commissioned by my daughter, Theodora,
and with her full countenance, I return to you this
ring, of which we have as little need as the honor of
your society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day they hoped again to meet the old
man, but he was no where to be found, and even
their gossiping landlady knew nothing of him—so
they were obliged to give up all hope of seeing him
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early on the following morning they set out for
their dear home, and as the carriage drove through
the avenue of trees before the house, and Theodora
in vain endeavored to conceal her fast falling tears,
which came so fast at the remembrance of the happiness
now fled forever, some one behind them
panted out—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold—for Heaven’s sake, stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robert!” cried Theodora, and sunk back, almost
fainting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drive on,” said her father; and the driver
cracked his whip, and the light carriage flew swiftly
from its pursuer, whose exclamations were soon lost
in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just as they reached the extreme end of the
village, a dashing vehicle from the opposite direction
rattled by. Heavens! there on the back seat, between
the two bold, gaudy ladies, sat—the gambler.
As the lightning illumines the dark night, did the
truth flash upon Theodora’s mind. The faithful
lover who had pursued her carriage, and from whom
she had so unrelentingly fled, could not be identical
with the man whom they had just seen apparently
returning from some nightly revel. The resemblance
was indeed wonderful, but it was only a resemblance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Robert, Robert!” sobbed the unhappy girl,
“how wretched I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust in God, dear child,” said her father; “all
is for the best. His ways are not as our ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! all hope has gone, and I—I alone am
guilty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks ago how much happiness the little
carriage had contained, but now how dark every thing
seemed. Still as they approached the dear home,
their sorrow grew milder, and when on the fifth day
they were greeted by the <span class='it'>patois</span> of their native province,
thoughts of their return were uppermost in
Theodora’s mind. Her father brought back what he
had scarcely dared to hope for in this life, health, and
she had some little token for each member of the
dear circle. A warm shawl for her mother, the embroidered
kerchief for Hermine, a book for Ernst,
and a sabre for the young soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the white tower of the castle of R——
gleamed in the twilight, and on every side dear
familiar objects greeted them. There the pine
wood, and now over the forget-me-not brook
under the hanging-boughs of the willows around
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
the mill, and they were in the village. And what a
joyful welcome awaited them here. “It is our dear
pastor,” resounded from all sides, caps were waved,
and hands thrust into the carriage windows. The
pastor bowed right and left with emotion, but as the
carriage drove by the church he uncovered his venerable
head, and a grateful prayer gushed from his
overflowing heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they turned the corner, and the peaceful parsonage
embowered in its magnificent trees stood before
them, mother and children came hastening to meet
them with cries of joy. “Children,” cried the pastor,
“it has all gone!—you need no longer creep
round so quietly, and try not to touch me. Come
here! and pinch me, I am really well again, and we
must thank the dear Lord and Theodora for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear sister! O father! mother! brother!”
sounded on all sides, and there was no end to the joyful
welcome. And the noise and glee all began anew
when the trunks were unpacked, and the presents
produced. And the questions and answers! Paul
wished particularly to know how many lions and tigers
his father had seen on the journey. Hermine,
how the ladies in A—— were dressed, and the mother
what they had for dinner. All were satisfied, and
went happy to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the morning came, the day passed, and in the
evening there wandered in the park unhappy love.
But Theodora suffered no longer in secret, her mother’s
heart and her father’s kind words offered healing
to her wounded soul, although she felt that for
her there was no happiness left. On the sixth day
the post brought a letter for Theodora. She handed
it tremblingly to her father, and sank upon a seat,
while her father read aloud to her, as follows—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Theodora, my Theodora, I am the happiest of
mortals! Wherever I turn I see nothing but happiness
and joy. The sky is clear and blue above me,
and you love me and will always love me. You have
repelled me, but indeed you knew me not. You have
left my ring in the hands of vice, but how could you
know it? Did I not myself doubt my own identity
when I first saw him? Is not that vile fellow, Rodel,
my perfect double? But all is right again, and I have
your ring upon my finger. Hear how it all came
about. The day after you left, I went to the promenade
overwhelmed with agony at your departure,
and your manner toward me. There I saw the detestable
gambler, Rodel, and a ray of light from his
finger caught my eye. I looked at it more attentively—it
was the very ring that I had given you. I felt
that I must instantly know how he came by it, and
perhaps it would unravel the mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sir,’ said I, turning to him, ‘you have a fine
stone there.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do you like it?’ said the fellow with assumed
nonchalance, ‘<span class='it'>ma foi</span>, it does not look amiss, and
from a fair one too.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I controlled myself, followed him to his room,
and stepping up to him, said coldly and seriously—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Rodel, be pleased to tell me upon this spot
how you came by that ring.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>En vérité mon enfant</span>,’ laughed he, ‘you are
very amusing, but I am not in a joking humor, what
do you want of me?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The ring,’ replied I, ‘and an open confession of
how you came by it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I can easily tell you that, the more readily as I
think you already guess the truth. I received it from
my lady fair, Miss Theodora S——. Ah! my dear fellow,
she is <span class='it'>un morceau de prince</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name, dear love, sounded to my heart like
a thunderclap, but only because such lips dared to
pronounce it, for I never for an instant supposed that
he owed the ring to any thing but some miserable
fraud. Without allowing myself to be outwardly disturbed
by the man’s impudence, ‘no more of this,’
I said, ‘give me the ring this moment, or I will immediately
inform Gen. B—— of the ingenious trick by
which he lost his two thousand louis d’ors yesterday.
You may have seen me before? I have also seen
you, and although yesterday it was none of my business,
and I did not feel myself called upon to act as
guardian to your dupes, to-day the office suits me exactly.
So choose—the ring, and an explanation, or
the general’s whip, and my pistols.’ Pale and
trembling, the wretch drew the ring from his finger
and handed it to me with your father’s note. I hastened
away with my heart filled with happiness.
All was clear to me—only your grief in being so deceived
troubled me. No, my Theodora, I am not
unworthy of you. Tell every thing to your father,
and commend me to his love. I would write to him
but I cannot. Yes, Theodora, there is mystery still,
the time for explanation is not yet arrived, but I can
see nothing but joy in store for us. Trust in my fervent
eternal love as I trusted in yours. It is impossible
for you to answer this, for you do not know
where I am; I, myself do not know where I may be
to-morrow. But soon I shall be with you, never to
leave you but to be always your own,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Robert</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Theodora’s eyes now sparkled with love and joy,
but her father silently folded the letter again and gave
it to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, father?” she asked, “you say nothing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I say?” replied her father. “He has
acted nobly, and that he really loves you is clear to
me. But, beware my child, the tempter goeth about
as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a new life had begun for Theodora. She soon
knew the dear letter by heart, and thought only of
<span class='it'>his</span> return. Thus a week passed away, and another,
when the post again brought a letter for her father,
marked <span class='it'>private</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From my dear friend, Dr. S——, of the springs at
A——, said he, as he locked himself into his study,
and seating himself in his arm-chair, read the following—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear old Friend</span>,—I have so little time for
writing any thing but prescriptions in this busy place,
that you will be surprised indeed to receive this.
But your happiness is mine, and I can no longer keep
secret what I know is in store for you. The twenty
dollars that you in your simple benevolence slipped into
the hands of the old gray-coat, has brought you interest
indeed. That shabby was Sir William C——, the
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
rich English banker, who diseased in body, and plunged
into insane misanthrophy by the death of his wife,
and of all save one of four children, to whom he was
devotedly attached, spent this summer at the springs.
At the urgent solicitation of his only son, a young
man of most prepossessing manners and appearance,
I had been for some time attending him, when you
met him in the garden. Your kindness to him when
you could not know him, his conversation with you,
and your warm, humane nature made the greatest
impression upon him, and so moved him that he
was immediately afterward seized with a violent attack
of illness, which proved a favorable crisis, and
his health both of body and mind is completely restored.
His gratitude to you knows no bounds. He
is now, by my advice, traveling through Italy previous
to coming to R——, where he intends to present
himself at your door in his former shabby dress, and
require at your hands the friendship you so generously
proffered him. As for his son, ask your
daughter, Theodora, she can tell you far more about
him than I can. All this I should not have told you,
but how could I help it? With the warmest congratulations,
and repeated injunctions laid upon you
to keep the secret from your wife and children better
than I have been able to keep it from you, believe
me, my dear old friend, truly yours,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Herman A——.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was long before the worthy pastor became convinced
that all this was no dream, but when the reality
burst upon him, he folded his hands, and his heart
was filled with love and gratitude to God. “But,”
said he to himself, “how can I keep all this from my
dear Catharine? Heaven grant that that for the first
time in my life I may keep my tongue between my
teeth, and not betray every thing as my old friend
here has done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” said his wife at supper, “your face
shines like Moses, when he came down from the
mount. What did the doctor write about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!—he—why of course about every thing that
is going on at the springs, about the flowers, and my
<span class='it'>Banksia serrata</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And nothing,” asked Theodora, “of the old man
and—and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what should he know of them?” said her
father. “Doubtless the young fellow has forgotten
our existence, dear Dora, but don’t be troubled, we
are so happy here.” And then he bit his lips, and
swallowed the secret as best he could, and as he was
obliged to do fifty times a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the autumn passed, the winter came, and
with it that joyous time, which, for the sake of the
dear child born long ago in Bethlehem, makes
children of us all. But no news of the absent ones;
only the intelligence from the capital that the count
had sold his castle of R——, and that the new lord
would take possession at Christmas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said the pastor, “the new lord can
hardly be worse than the old one, and very easily
better and more generous, so we may in future have
a merrier Christmas than this will be, for this time,
children, affairs look rather gloomy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! we know, father,” cried the joyous children.
“You always say so—you always try to frighten us
with the idea of no Christmas, but it always turns
out well. Didn’t Ursula slip in yesterday evening,
at the back-door, with a splendid Christmas tree?
We didn’t see it, to be sure, but we heard it. And
didn’t mother and Dora gild the apples and nuts, and
cut out the stars yesterday evening? You thought
we were in bed, but we peeped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” laughed their father; “to-morrow
will be Christmas-eve, and of course you will go to
bed bright and early, that you may be up in time the
next morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” shouted the children; “to-morrow
evening is just the time when the Christ-child comes
to us. Have we not just seen Ursula making our
Christmas-cake? Oh, dear, angel of a father, we
will be so good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day all without was dreary and stormy;
the heavy snow-flakes fell all day long, but within
it was bright and cheerful. Ursula had swept and
dusted every nook and corner of the house, and the
fires all burned brightly. In the study the father and
mother were busy all the morning; the children,
meanwhile, looked wisely at one another, and tried
to keep back the smiles that would dimple out every
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At three o’clock, according to the custom of the
house, the holyday began. The fragrance of the
fresh Christmas-cake was wafted through the house,
mother and children were all dressed in their holyday
attire, and the father, easy and happy that the
morrow’s sermon was prepared, sat and smoked in
his arm-chair. At four o’clock Theodora came in
from the gardener’s, where she had been in all the
storm to carry a slice of the Christmas-cake, with
the intelligence that strangers had arrived at the village
inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This news made the good pastor restless, and after
pacing up and down the room, he went to the window,
and rubbing the moisture from the pane, looked
out. And there, just round the corner, crept the old
man in the gray coat, with his hands behind him, as
formerly, and he walked up the steps and knocked
at the door. “Courage,” said the pastor to himself,
and hastened out to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am,” said the old man, in a hollow voice,
his looks bent on the ground, “I have fortunately arrived
here at last, but I am weary and ill, and I have
no one to pity me. Do you remember your kind
words; will you take me in? What! No reply?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The honest pastor could not reply. This was
what he had so long looked forward to, and now he
was really grieved that the kind heart of the old man
could not enjoy the brief pleasure of his little surprise.
But as he stood silently there, the old man
raised his eyes, met that look of love and sorrow,
and threw himself into his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” cried he, “no longer bent with age, but
erect and strong—away with dissimulation! O my
benefactor, I am—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay!” interrupted the pastor, “there shall indeed
be no dissembling in this happy moment. Sir
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
William C——, I know you. The doctor wrote me
all about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take me, then, to your wife and children; they
are mine, you are mine, but you must take me for
payment, and keep me for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” said the pastor, “my wife and children
know nothing of the secret, now see what they will
say. Come in, dear guest, come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” cried Theodora, joyfully, “our old man
from A——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children gathered round, the mother welcomed
him cordially, and seated him in the arm-chair
by the bright fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speechless he looked round upon them all, but
kept Theodora’s hand in his while his gaze rested
with evident satisfaction upon her lovely face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Light the colored Christmas candles, Catharine,”
said the father, “and seat yourselves all round the
table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he opened his desk, took from it the doctor’s
letter, stroked his wife’s cheek, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Catharine, all this has weighed upon me
like a mountain, but now all that I know, you, dear
ones, shall know, too, and our guest here shall tell
us whether it be true or no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he read the doctor’s letter. Let whoever
can, imagine the variety of emotions that overcame
all the listeners; the astonishment of the
mother, the gentle emotion of the guest, the alternate
red and white that overspread Theodora’s cheek, and
the delight of the little ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am, dear ones,” said the old man, at the
end of the reading, “and here I shall stay, in dear,
cheerful Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where then is—is—” stammered Theodora.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just then the door was flung open, and there
stood Robert, his eyes beaming with love and joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Robert! my Robert!” she cried, and would
have rushed toward him, but overcome by her happiness,
she sank into her mother’s arms. The old man
took his son’s hand, and turning to the pastor, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I woo your daughter for my noble son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I,” continued Robert, “be your son, O,
dear friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And may I say,” interrupted his father, “that
I have bought the castle yonder, and that I beg your
daughter’s acceptance of it as a bridal gift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son! my daughter!” cried the weeping
parents, and embraced the lovers, while the children
crowded round the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now for supper!” cried the pastor, “if there
is any one here who can ever eat again; and,
mamma, pray see that it is a real Christmas feast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then they seated themselves round the table,
and the old man, looking round upon the happy faces
about him, told how he had finished the tour of Italy,
and had determined to live for the rest of his life in
beautiful Germany. Then raising his glass, he drank
a heartfelt toast to them all. “And I have ordered
every thing for your comfort at the castle at Lee &amp;
Hammersmith’s, London; and for you, dear friend,”
turning to the pastor, “the choicest collection of
plants will arrive shortly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, heaven!” sighed the pastor, “How have I
deserved this—the <span class='it'>Banksia serrata, Plumeria</span>, and
divine <span class='it'>Strelitzia</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” said his guest, holding up the purse
which Seidelman had slipped into his hand at the
springs; “see your twenty dollars here—the purse
shall always remain in the family, and our posterity
shall read what is embroidered upon it—‘Charity
brings interest.’ But what makes the little ones so
restless?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said their father, “they want to go to
bed;” and he and his wife quietly left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” cried the children, “now the holy
child is coming, wait until we hear his little bell, and
then we shall go, and you, brother Robert, and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And soon the longed-for bell sounded, the children
rushed into the study, and bore along the older ones
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the Christmas heaven before them,
with its shining lights and stars. Theodora sprang
forward to take from the table her new white dress,
and forgot her castle. Hermine danced round her
<a id='new'></a>new work-box, Ernst round his tool-chest, and Paul
was immediately absorbed with his terrific cannon,
and new troops of soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother, coming behind the pastor, slipped on
him his new dressing-gown, and he uncovered the
corner of the table, where were her pretty slippers
and muff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, ye happy ones,” said Sir William, with tears
of real feeling, “how easy would it be for me to
cover this table with gold, and say, ‘Take it—it is
all yours,’ but could it give you one moment of the
happiness that these simple gifts of love afford you.
O let me be a child with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, we will all be children,” cried they,
and embraced each other, while the pastor raised
his eyes to heaven, and blessed them, saying, “Of
such is the kingdom of heaven.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Aylmere, or the Bondman of Kent; and Other Poems.
By Robert T. Conrad. 1 Vol. Philadelphia; E. H.
Butler &amp; Co.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this volume is one of those rare organizations,
intellectually, which have the power of transmuting
whatever they touch into gold. As an orator,
he sways his audience at will; as a writer, he storms
the reader’s judgment by logic and declamation welded
into one; and as a poet, he now charms the fancy with
the grace and delicacy of his imagery, and now makes
the heart throb with his fiery and impassioned words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aylmere” is a dramatic poem, originally written for
Mr. Forrest, and still played, under the name of “Jack
Cade,” by that eminent tragedian. Though parts of it
may derive additional power, on the stage, from the
magnificent bursts of the great actor for whom it was
composed, the true beauty of the drama, we think,
can only be enjoyed by those who peruse it, at leisure,
in the closet. Many passages, indeed, are suppressed on
the boards, in order to bring the play within accustomed
limits; and the benefit of these the spectator loses entirely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drama of “Aylmere” is founded on the famous
insurrection of 1450, in which the English peasantry
were headed by a physician, known indifferently as Jack
Cade, Aylmere, Mendall and Mortimer. The theme is
one peculiarly fitted for a republican poet. Goaded by
intolerable wrongs, social as well as political—insults
to their women, contumely to themselves, public taxes
that reaped them to the last stubble, and private exactions
on the part of the nobility, that gleaned what little
regal rapacity had left—the people, in which we comprise
the yeomen and burghers, as well as the villeins,
rose in a body, marched on London, exacted the death
of the infamous lord-chamberlain, and procured a charter
from the king, guarantying to the commonalty the
rights and privileges demanded by their leader. But
scarcely had these concessions been granted, when a
collision, provoked probably by the royal party, occurred
between the citizens of London and the followers of
Cade: the insurgents met with a repulse; and the late
terrified aristocracy rallying, a total defeat and dispersion
of the peasantry ensued. Aylmere himself was
hunted down, like a wild beast, and mercilessly put to
death. The concessions granted were revoked. And,
for centuries after, English historians in the interest of
the upper classes, blackened the name and misrepresented
the motives of the ill-fated Kentish reformer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What nobler task could a republican poet set before
himself, than to rescue the reputation of this martyred
hero from obloquy and shame? Well, too, has Judge
Conrad fulfilled his pious labor. The principal character
of the play is Aylmere, of course; indeed he may be
said, in one sense, to be the entire play. His lofty
courage, his abhorrence of wrong, his high aspirations
after liberty, and the fiery enthusiasm which he breathes
into his followers, form, as it were, the deep undertone,
whose thunders roll incessantly through this grand anthem
of freedom. Other characters, however, contribute
materially to the action of the piece, and furnish
the author with opportunities to display his dramatic
powers. The portrait of Marianne, the wife of Aylmere,
is drawn with great tenderness of feeling, and delicacy
of touch: she is, like her own native Italy, a vision of
immortal beauty hallowed and sanctified by wo. The
cruel, vindictive and insolent Say; the gay, careless,
yet not wholly wicked Clifford; the friend of the people,
Friar Lacy; and the yeomen, Wat Worthy and Will
Mowbray, all stand prominently out from the canvas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drama is full of noble poetry. It would give us
pleasure to quote more largely from it, in proof of this;
but the quantity of books upon our table, requiring
notice, forbids a monopoly of our limited space by one.
We cannot, however, resist making a few extracts.
Here is one, in which Aylmere, after his return from
Italy, eloquently describes the bondage which he shared
in common with his fellow-Englishmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tragedy violates, in some of its details, the facts
of history. Thus Aylmere, instead of being defeated and
betrayed, as in the real story, perishes, in the drama, at
the very hour that the charter is granted. The change
enables the author to give a fine artistic scene as his
closing one. Marianne, the wife, having been separated
from her husband at the outset of the insurrection, falls
into the power of Lord Say. While thus a prisoner she
is accosted with dishonorable proposals by Lord Clifford,
whom she stabs to escape indignity. For this heroic act
she is thrown into the castle dungeon, scourged, and
visited with other brutalities, till she loses her reason.
Escaping eventually, she rejoins her husband. In Aylmere’s
last interview with Lord Say, when the latter,
dying, poniards the former, she rushes in, her intellect
restored, as is often the case before death, and perishes
with her lord. This furnishes the material for the closing
scene, which is most dramatically conceived. Clasping
the fair corpse in his arms, the hero is himself sinking
into death, when suddenly loud huzzas in the street,
call him back to life. He starts up with a wild cry of
exultation, and asks eagerly what it means. The attendants
reply, “the charter!” and, as they speak, the
parchment, duly sealed, is brought triumphantly in.
Aylmere rushes to it, kisses it, clasps it to his bosom,
and exclaiming that the bondmen are avenged and England
free, totters toward Marianne, falls, and dies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the drama is not the only poem in the volume, for
some fifty fugitive pieces ensue, the chance contributions
of a life devoted generally to pursuits more stern.
Several of the last of these originally appeared in the
pages of this magazine: we may mention “The Sons
of the Wilderness,” and the “Sonnets on the Lord’s
Prayer.” Generally they are distinguished by great
felicity of expression, a vigorous imagination, touches
of exquisite pathos, and a lofty scorn of whatever is base,
cruel, or wrong. As examples of the gentler mood of
the author’s muse, we would point out two poems,
which evidently relate to a mother and her daughter:
the first, “Lines on the death of a Young Married
Lady,” and the second, “To Maggie.” The sonnet,
“To My Wife,” is also very beautiful. As specimens
of Judge Conrad’s more indignant mood, we refer to the
sonnets, “On the Invasion of the Roman Republic,”
and to “Fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poem, “To My Brother,” is one that would have
made the author’s reputation, even if he had written
nothing else; and “Freedom” contains stanzas that but
few other living poets could have penned. To say that
it exhibits the power of the fourth canto of “Childe
Harold,” would imply imitation, of which certainly no
one can accuse Judge Conrad. But we may remark that
it has the same nervous style, the same exalted imagination,
with an original conception that is all its own. In
perusing this and other poems in this volume we instinctively
regret that Judge Conrad has not devoted
himself entirely to poetry. Such powers as his, concentrated
on a pursuit so congenial to him, could not but
have produced results that would have adorned American
literature, not only temporarily, but throughout all
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot take leave of our author without going
back to the dedication, which is addressed to the poet’s
father, and which, though often quoted in print since
the appearance of the book, we venture to quote again.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Poems. By Richard Henry Stoddard. Boston: Ticknor,
Reed &amp; Fields. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible to open this volume at any page without
feeling that the author is a poet, and a poet whose
promise is very much greater even than his performance.
Every poem is bright and warm with imagery
and feeling—poetical expressions are showered with a
liberal hand—the verse has that soft and fluent movement
which indicates that the thoughts they convey
come from a teeming mind in a gush of melodious sentiment—and
the impression left on the reader’s imagination
is of a singularly rich, sensuous, fertile and poetical
nature. Every poem, almost every line, is a protest
against the prose of thought and the prose of life, and all
the objects of sense are studiously idealized and heightened
into “something rich” if not into “something
strange.” The author seems to dwell in a dream of
life, peopled with beauties if not with Beauty, and
sweetly abandoning himself to the soft and subtle sensations
they imaginatively excite. Pleasure, but a pleasure
more than mortal, seems to be his aim and aspiration,
and infinitely provoked is he when the hard facts
of life protrude their misshapen but solid substance into
his meditations, and mock his luxurious illusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the mood out of which this profuse idealization
of thoughts and sensations proceeds is undoubtedly
poetical, but it should be exhibited in connection with
higher and sterner qualities, and at best indicates the
youth of the poetic vision and faculty. But, it must be
admitted, that Mr. Stoddard has represented it in all its
deliciousness, and no person can read his volume without
being filled and stimulated with its sweetness and
melody, and luxuriant fancy and opulence of sensuous
forms and images. It indicates, to some extent, a sensitive
and imaginative nature overmastered by the pleasant
scenes and airy beings in which and with whom it
revels—possessed instead of possessing—and therefore
lacking that individual power which wields dominion
over its own resources, selects, discriminates, rejects,
governs, and, in the highest sense, combines and creates.
Accordingly he does not inform objects, but is rather
informed by them—does not pass into them by an internal
force but is rather drawn into them by their external
attraction—and thus leaves an impression rather of fertility
than power. There is a great difference between
the poet who merges himself in objects, and the poet
who allows objects to immerge him. In the one case he
is a victor, in the other a captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
As a result of this exceeding sensitiveness to impressions,
Mr. Stoddard is open to the influence of other
poets; for when a poet once ceases to exercise a jealous
guardianship over the individuality of his genius, he is
liable to be overcome by the superior power of the natures
with whom he sympathises. Now, Mr. Stoddard
is no copyist or imitator, much less a plagiarist, but he
evidently has an intense love for the genius of Shelley,
Keats and Tennyson, and sympathises so deeply with
them that he catches the tone and tune of their spirits—sometimes
sets his own songs to their music—and thus
gives us original thoughts and images that <span class='it'>sound</span> like
theirs because conceived in their spirit. Thus in the
“Castle in the Air” there is an original line which still
has the mark of Shelley’s individuality upon it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Like some divinest dream upon the couch of sleep.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It would be easy to select many more illustrations of
this unconscious imitation, proving, not that Mr. Stoddard
is a borrower, but that he is not on his guard
against the magnetic power of other minds, exercised as
it is through the most subtile avenues of mental influence.
It should be his ambition not to differ in degree
from the poets he loves, but to differ in <span class='it'>kind</span>. It is
better to be Stoddard than to be a Tennysonian, especially,
as in the present case, when Stoddard contains
within himself the elements of a new individuality in
letters, with a force and flavor and fragrance of his
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have been thus prolix and minute in characterizing
some of the peculiarities of this volume, because we
are convinced that the author is a man of genius, and
has a right to be tried by laws of criticism severer than
those which apply to the common run of versifiers. But
we are not insensible to the excellencies of the poems;
willingly plead guilty to the charge of having read the
volume with delight, and trust that we shall entice
many of our readers into the same pleasant employment.
They evince thought, sentiment, fancy, imagination,
delicacy and depth of nature; every thing but directing
will and a broad perception of the true poetical relations
of the ideal and the actual; and these will come with
the growth of his mind, and a larger and more genial
experience of life. We had marked many passages to
illustrate our idea both of his merits and his defects, but
we have no space at present to quote them. The gorgeous
“Castle in the Air,” the leading poem in the
volume, would furnish many a splendid example of the
fluency and fertility of his genius. “The Witch’s
Whelp” is an original conception of a different kind.
The Songs and Sonnets, toward the close of the volume,
are perhaps, the most individual and essentially original
poems of the collection, and some of them display uncommon
subtilty and sharpness of mental vision.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>A Book of Romances, Lyrics and Songs. By Bayard
Taylor. Boston: Ticknor, Read &amp; Fields, 1 vol.
16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Bayard Taylor’s peculiarities as a poet are the same
which have won him so much popularity as a man, and
refer to his character as well as his mind. Fine, however
as is the impression conveyed by his numerous
prose works, we think that no reader can carefully peruse
the present volume without feeling that the best
embodiment of the man is in these poems. They are
thoroughly genuine, recording the thoughts and aspirations
nearest and dearest to the author’s heart and brain,
and o’erinformed with the life of a thoughtful, imaginative
and genial nature. Some of them are darkened by
a recent affliction, and to those friends who know how
deep and acute that affliction was, they can hardly be
read without tears. But the majority of the poems express
the essential happiness of the author’s spirit, and
communicate happiness to the reader. That descriptive
power, which has made him one of the most fascinating
of modern writers of travels, is of course active in the
present volume in its most exquisite form. Indeed, as
a poet, he does not so much describe as represent
scenery, picturing it forth to the imagination in words
and images which seem the mental counterparts of the
objects before his eye. As a descriptive poet alone, he
would rank high among contemporary authors, but he is
also a close and subtle observer of the operations of
thought and passion, as modified by individual character,
and numerous pieces in this volume indicate intensity
and concentration of thought, exercised on some of
the most elusive and etherial laws and facts of the spiritual
nature. In addition to all this, his style of expression
is pure, energetic and picturesque, and varies
readily with his themes. The best poem in the volume,
and one which we think has good pretensions to be
ranked with American classics, is “Man-da-Min, or the
Romance of the Maize,” an Indian legend of great
beauty, and, in Taylor’s version, exquisite in idea and
masterly in execution. “Hylas,” “Taurus,” “The
Summer Camp,” “The Odalisque,” “The Pine Forest
of Monterey,” and “The Waves,” are likewise of great
merit, and exhibit the variety as well as power of the
author’s mind. Cordially do we wish success to this
volume, and trust that Taylor will live to write, and we
to welcome many like it.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Home Book of the Picturesque, or American Scenery,
Art and Literature; with Thirteen Engravings on Steel,
from Pictures by Eminent Artists, Engraved expressly
for this Work. New York: George P. Putnam. 1 vol.
folio.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The American public have become so accustomed to
Mr. Putnam’s enterprise, that they may not be surprised
even by this splendid example of it—a volume essentially
American, yet in engravings, letter-press, and general
execution equal to the best English annuals, and in the
merits of its literary matter far superior to them. The
cost and trouble of getting up the book may be conceived,
when we mention that the pictures from which the exquisite
illustrations of the volume are engraved, are
scattered among many collectors, and that the execution
of the plates exhibits the utmost skill and finish which
the art of engraving has reached in America. The essays
which accompany the engravings are by what old
Jacob Tonson called “eminent hands.” Irving contributes
a paper on the “Catskill Mountains,” which
seems like an essay accidently left out of the “Sketch
Book,” and is certainly worthy of a place among the
most charming productions of his genius. Cooper’s article
on “American and European Scenery,” is a carefully
meditated and attractive disquisition on a subject which
has occasioned endless discussion, but which was never
treated so thoroughly and temperately before. Tuckerman’s
“Over the Mountains” is an admirable essay.
“Scenery and Mind,” by Magoun, is the most eloquent,
thoughtful, scholarly and tasteful of his productions.
Willis contributes a brilliant and sensible paper on “The
Highland Terrace,” in his most fascinating style. The
artists whose landscapes make the beauty of the volume,
are Durand, Huntington, Beekwith, Talbot, Kensett,
Cropsey, Richards, Church, Weir, Cole and Gignoux.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
Altogether, the volume is the best exhibition of American
art in connection with American literature we
have ever seen, and must take the lead among the gift-books
of the season.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Human Body and its Connection with Man, Illustrated
by the Principal Organs. By John James Garth
Wilkinson. Member of the Royal College of Surgeons
of England. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Grambo &amp; Co.
1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this curious and attractive volume is
well-known as the English editor of Swedenborg’s
works, and the writer of Swedenborg’s life, and, in the
opinion of Emerson, is “a philosophic critic, with a co-equal
vigor of understanding and imagination comparable
only to Lord Bacon’s.” Without attempting to discuss
the accuracy of this opinion, which is at least the result
of a study of Mr. Wilkinson’s whole works, it is sufficient
to say here that the author of this volume is one of
the most vivid, pointed and striking writers of the century;
and that, however solid or doubtful may be his
pretensions to great scientific merits, there can be no
doubt of the brilliancy of his rhetoric and the fertility of
his intellect in original thoughts. A review of the present
work we do not intend to give, but simply recommend
it to all readers as a powerful, independent, suggestive
and stimulating book, lifting the study of anatomy
and physiology into a fine art, and abounding with new
views both of the body and the mind. The chief peculiarity
of Mr. Wilkinson seems to us to be a singular
vigor and audacity of will, in some cases running into
offensive dogmatism, but generally exercised in freeing
his intellect from the trammels both of accredited skepticisms
and authorities, and in stamping his own opinions
with such force upon the mind of the reader, as to create
himself into a kind of authority. There is muscular
health and strength in every sentence of his remarkable
book, and a seeming gladness in the exercise of his faculties
which is wonderfully inspiring to the reader.</p>

and happy, that it creates a jubilee in the brain as we
read. It is intended for children, but let not the intention
cheat men and women out of the pleasure they will
find in its sparkling and genial pages. The stories are
told by a certain Eustice Bright to a mob of children,
whose real names the author suppresses, but whom he
re-baptizes with the fairy appellation of Primrose, Periwinkle,
Sweet Fern, Dandelion, Blue-Eye, Clover,
Huckleberry, Cowslip, Squash-blossom, Milk-weed,
Plantain and Butter-cup. The individuality of these
little creatures is happily preserved, especially in the
criticisms and applications they make after each story is
told; and the reader parts with them unwillingly, and
with the hope (which the author should not disappoint)
of resuming their acquaintance in another volume. The
stories, six in number, are classical myths, re-cast to
suit the author’s purpose, and told with exquisite grace,
simplicity and playfulness. The book will become the
children’s classic, and, to our taste, is fairly the best of
its kind in English literature. It is a child’s story-book
informed with the finest genius.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Captains of the Old World, as Compared with the
Great Modern Strategists, their Campaigns, Characters
and Conduct, from the Persian to the Punic Wars.
By Henry William Herbert. New York: Charles
Scribner. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume is all alive and glowing with the fiery
characteristics of Mr. Herbert’s genius, while it has at the
same time the best results of his earnest, independent
thinking, and profound and accurate scholarship. The
title sufficiently declares its purpose, and its execution
is worthy of the theme. It gives a most animated account
of the Greek and Roman tactics and military organization,
and of the lives of the great ancient commanders,
commencing with Miltiades and ending, for
the present, with Hannibal. Themistocles, Pausanius,
Xenophon, Epaminondas and Alexander, are learnedly
and eloquently sketched, and parallels are drawn between
them and the celebrated captains of modern
times, in which the author shows a knowledge of military
science as well as his usual power of vivid painting.
The work is dedicated to Professor Felton, of Harvard
University. It cannot fail to have that wide circulation
which it so eminently merits, for it happily combines
elements of interest which will recommend it equally to
scholars and the mass of readers.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Life of John Sterling. By Thomas Carlyle. Boston:
Phillips, Sampson &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is one of the most powerful of Carlyle’s many productions,
and, as a biography, is to be ranked among the
best in English literature. It bristles as usual with the
author’s harsh scorn of every thing he is pleased to call
cant, falsehood, and moonshine; but there are glimpses in
it of deep and genuine tenderness, and, of all his works, it
best indicates the humanity of the man. The mental
characteristics of Sterling himself, are drawn with a
loving and friendly yet discriminating pencil, and the
few events of his life are narrated with singular skill.
The sketches of Sterling’s friends and contemporaries,
especially the portrait of Coleridge, add much to the
interest of the volume. There are specimens also of a
sort of savage humor equal to Carlyle’s best efforts in
that kind. The style, though full of vigor and flashing
with imagery, is as craggy and uneven as ever; exhibiting,
in the constant recurrence of a few slang words,
how formal after all is this inveigher against formulas,
and how his hatred of affectation becomes itself a sort of
cant. But the soul of the book is sound and manly; and
no one can read it without feeling that he has been in
communion with a deep and great, if somewhat embittered
nature.</p>

to all classes of readers, containing a vast amount

to Waterloo. By E. S. Creasy, M. A. New
York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of this valuable volume is taken from a remark
of Hallam on Charles Martel’s victory over the invading
Saracens, which he calls one of “those few battles,
of which a contrary event would have essentially
varied the drama of the world in all its subsequent
scenes.” Mr. Creasy is Professor of History in University
College, London, and is well fitted to do justice
to his great theme. The battles described are Marathon,
Syracuse, Arbela, and Metaurus; the victory of Arminius
over the Roman legions under Varus; the battles of
Chalons, Tours, and Hastings; Joan of Arc’s victory at
Orleans, the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and the battles
of Blenheim, Pultowa, Saratoga, Valmy, and Waterloo.
The execution of the work is excellent. The liberality
of the author’s mind is indicated by his lofty conception
of the power and the mission of the United States, given
in the introductory remarks to his description of the
battle of Saratoga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A capital volume, designed chiefly for academies and
schools, but containing matter more important to readers
in general than even to school-boys. It is a work in which
the leading principles of chemistry are familiarly explained,
and applied to the arts, agriculture, physiology,
dietetics, ventilation, and the phenomena of nature. The
writer is well qualified for his task, for he seems perfectly
to comprehend the ignorance of the majority of
readers on the subjects he explains, and accordingly directs
his explanations primarily to exactly those principles
which require illustration, before the mind is fitted

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume contains the lives of Mary of Lorraine,
the second queen of James V., and Lady Margaret
Douglas, Countess of Lenox. These biographies are quite
able and interesting, giving vivid pictures of Scottish
feuds, life, and manners in the sixteenth century, and exhibiting

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crosby and Nichols, of Boston</span>, have sent us some
eight or ten delightful little story-books for children, to
which we call the attention of parents in these holyday

<hr class='tbk164'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dentistry.</span>—Our attention has recently been called
to the very superior mechanical execution of full sets of
teeth, manufactured by a young townsman of ours—J.
Sothoron Gilliams, Esq.—which in all respects surpass
any thing of the kind we have elsewhere observed.
Doctor Gilliams, however, brings to the practice of his
profession, not only the nice observation of years of the
superior skill of his father, but also a thorough medical
education and assiduous attention to the mechanical arrangement
and finish of his labors. It is a mistaken
notion—but one that is common—to suppose, that a poor
shoemaker or an indifferent tailor may make a very tolerable
dentist, and we are sure that a few more examples
of thorough education for the practice of the profession,
such as Dr. Gilliams has secured, will do much to send
adrift the vast army of pretenders and quacks who now
torture and fleece humanity as surgeon dentists. It is
strange, that while no man would thoughtlessly put a
horse into the hands of one of these fellows, yet people
are to be found who will allow them to afflict and disfigure
the mouths of their daughters with perfect indifference.
We trust, however, that among the many
thousands who read “Graham” none will hereafter
suffer themselves to be duped by ignorant pretenders,
with high-sounding titles, while gentlemen of education
and superior skill—but who modestly keep silent—are in
the midst of us.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Volume for 1852.</span>—Our readers will see from
the style in which the January number is put forth, that
we are in earnest for 1852 in our efforts to render “Graham”
superior as a work of literature and art. The
plan marked out and indicated in our prospectus of
greatly increasing the literary matter of each number,
we shall resolutely adhere to, and as we claim the
merit of first suggesting and adopting the change, we
trust that those who partially follow us in January, will
not grow weary in well-doing as soon as the subscriptions
have been made up for the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far our readers may have opportunities of observing
the practice of some publishers, who fill sheets
with promises which are never thought of after the
January number is issued, we cannot say—but we now
ask some little attention to the matter for 1852.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
